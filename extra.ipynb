So, it is possible that in `thread2`, `x` is loaded before `y` (because of the memory fence), and thus it sees the updated value of `x` (1) and an outdated value of `y` (0). This can lead to `a` being set to 1. Similarly, in `thread3`, `y` is stored before `x` is loaded (due to the memory fence), and it could see the outdated value of `x` (0) leading to `b` being set to 1. But the assertion at the end of the main function will always pass because `y` will never be 2.\n",

This doesn't really change the outcome of this particular program from the TSO case, because it primarily relies on memory fences (not the order of stores) to synchronize threads. The values assigned to `a` and `b` are still dependent on the timing of thread execution and load/store operations.\n",

      "\n",
      "Total Store Order (TSO) is a relaxed memory model used by x86 processors. In TSO, stores from a processor may appear to execute in a different order with respect to loads from the same processor but the processor guarantees that all stores by a processor will appear in the order they were issued by that processor to all processors. Partial Store Order (PSO) is a more relaxed model than TSO. In PSO, both loads and stores can be reordered.\n",

One stores values `1` to `x` and `y` (thread1), and the other stores a `2` to `y` and loads the value of `x` (thread2). There is also a memory barrier, `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst);`, in thread1 after the store to `x`. \n",

This is because the write to y in thread2 can come before the write to x in thread1 due to the reordering of writes that can happen under TSO and PSO.\n",

      "Therefore, although you’re using `std::memory_order_relaxed` on all operations and a sequentially consistent fence in one of the threads, you could still have a failing assert in a TSO or PSO model because of the reordering. This issue is due to the fact that you’re using a relaxed order, which allows such reordering, and only using the fence in one thread, so the other thread doesn’t have the same view of the memory.\n",

      "Here's why: In thread 2, a memory fence (atomic_thread_fence) is placed between loading 'y' and storing 'x'. This ensures that the store operation (x=1) does not happen before 'y' is loaded. Thus, if 'y' is seen as 1, this means that thread 1's store operation ta 'x' and 'y' have been committed, and 'x' must be 2. Hence, 'x' cannot be 1 (the new value from thread 2) yet, since that would contradict the order enforced by the memory fence.\n",

However, a store can be reordered with regard to subsequent loads (reads) from a different location. This allows for the possibility that when thread 2 reads the value of 'y' as 1, the store of 'x' as 1 (in thread2) might have already occurred due to reordering by the memory model, leading to the assert condition becoming false and the program causing an assertion failure.\n",

      "The provided program spawns three threads:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1 (`thread1`)**:\n",
      "   - Atomically stores `1` to `x` with relaxed memory order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2 (`thread2`)**:\n",
      "   - Loads `x` with relaxed memory order into `p`.\n",
      "   - Performs a sequentially consistent fence (to enforce ordering before and after the fence).\n",
      "   - Loads `y` with relaxed memory order into `q`.\n",
      "   - If `p` is `1` and `q` is `0`, stores `1` to `a` with relaxed memory order.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thread 3 (`thread3`)**:\n",
      "   - Atomically stores `1` to `y` with relaxed memory order.\n",
      "   - Performs a sequentially consistent fence.\n",
      "   - Loads `x` with relaxed memory order into `r`.\n",
      "   - If `r` is `0`, stores `1` to `b` with relaxed memory order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The `main` function checks whether the assertion `y != 2 || a != 1` holds after all threads have completed execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Model Effects\n",
      "#### Total Store Order (TSO)\n",
      "In TSO memory model:\n",
      "- Store operations are visible to other threads in the same order they were issued by the thread.\n",
      "- Load operations might get reordered, but stores are ordered relative to each other.\n",
      "- A store-following-load reordering is allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the fences in `thread2` and `thread3`, TSO ensures that:\n",
      "- In `thread2`, the fence ensures that `p = x.load()` happens-before `q = y.load()`.\n",
      "- In `thread3`, the fence ensures that `y.store(1)` happens-before `r = x.load()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "TSO will ensure that:\n",
      "- `x.store(1)` in `thread1` will be visible to both `thread2` and `thread3` reasonably quickly.\n",
      "- Any write-to-read dependencies enforced by fences will be respected.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, **even under TSO**, there's no strict guarantee preventing `q` in `thread2` from seeing `0` while `y` is `1` in `thread3`. Depending on the interleaving of operations, the following sequence is possible:\n",
      "- `thread1` sets `x` to `1`.\n",
      "- `thread3` sets `y` to `1` and then sees `x` is `0` (if `thread1`'s store is delayed).\n",
      "- `thread3` stores `1` in `b`.\n",
      "- `thread2` sees `x` as `1` and `y` as `0` and stores `1` in `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's check the assertion:\n",
      "- When `y == 2` (i.e., two stores to `y` have been issued), the stores won't happen in this program, as `y` has a single store per thread (`y = 1` from `thread3` and initial value `y = 0`).\n",
      "\n",
      "Since there is no situation where `y == 2` can arise in this code:\n",
      "- The assertion essentially checks if `a == 1`.\n",
      "- Given TSO's loose consistency with relaxed stores, a valid interleaving might cause `a` to be `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO)\n",
      "In PSO memory model:\n",
      "- PSO allows even more freedom in reordering than TSO.\n",
      "- Stores to different locations can be observed by other threads in an order different from which they were issued.\n",
      "\n",
      "PSO could also result in observable behaviors where `a == 1` and `b == 1` based on possible races and relaxations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "Under both TSO and PSO, the following sequence might occur:\n",
      "- `thread1` writes `1` to `x`.\n",
      "- `thread3` reads `x` as `0` (delay or reordering of `thread1`'s store visibility) and writes `1` to `y`.\n",
      "- `thread2` reads `x` as `1` and `y` as `0`, causing it to write `1` to `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the assertion `y != 2 || a != 1` is liable to trigger, signifying a potential situation where `a == 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Takeaway:** Relaxed memory models such as TSO and PSO introduce more potential for non-intuitive interleavings, increasing the complexity of predicting concurrent program behavior and ensuring correctness without barriers, fences, and proper synchronization mechanisms.\n",

      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO):**\n",

      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO):**\n",

      "### How TSO and PSO Affect the Behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "For both memory models, it is key to understand the impact of `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Under TSO:\n",
      "- The presence of `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)` ensures that the operations are seen in the order they are issued. Specifically:\n",
      "  - In `thread1`, `x.store(1)` must be globally visible before `y.store(1)`.\n",
      "  - In `thread2`, `y.store(2)` must be globally visible before `x.load()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that:\n",
      "- If `y` is `2`, then the fence in `thread2` guarantees that the store to `x` in `thread1` should have been seen before `thread2` executed the load. Therefore `x.load()` should observe the value `1` that was stored by `thread1`.\n",
      "- Thus, the condition `if(p == 0)` should not be true if `x` is `1`. Therefore, `a.store(1)` should not be executed when `y` is `2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Under PSO:\n",
      "- Similar to TSO, the `std::atomic_thread_fence` provides strong ordering guarantees similar to sequential consistency (SC) regarding the marked operations.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Hence, the same reasoning applies:\n",
      "- If `y` is `2`, the fence in `thread2` ensures `x.load()` should see the value `1`. Thus, `if(p == 0)` should not be true.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Both TSO and PSO, in the presence of `std::atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst)`, guarantee that the program will not fail the assertion. This is because the fences ensure that `if (p == 0)` in `thread2` will not hold true if `y` is `2` following the described reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, under relaxed memory models like TSO and PSO, given the explicit sequential consistency fences (`std::atomic_thread_fence`), the assertion `assert(y != 2 || a != 1);` should always hold.\n",

      "### Possible Execution Scenario\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Relaxed Memory Ordering**:\n",
      "    - `thread1` executes `x.store(1, memory_order_relaxed)` and `y.store(1, memory_order_relaxed)`. Due to the relaxed memory order, although the program specifies the order, the hardware may not enforce the same strictly.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - `thread2` executes `y.store(2, memory_order_relaxed)`. This might happen before `x` is loaded, and might also happen after `thread1` or before `thread1` starts executing.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - After storing `2` to `y`, `thread2` loads the value of `x` into `p`. Now, because of relaxed memory ordering, it is possible:\n",
      "        - `x` is still 0 as stored action by `thread1` hasn't been observed by `thread2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "    - If `p` (loaded value of `x`) is `0`, `a.store(1, memory_order_relaxed)` will execute in `thread2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Assertion\n",
      "The assertion in the main function is:\n",
      "\n",
      "```cpp\n",
      "assert( y != 2  || a != 1 );\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This assertion expects that:\n",
      "- If `y` equals `2`, then `a` should not be `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, considering the relaxed memory ordering, we have:\n",
      "- `y` could be `2` as stored by `thread2`.\n",
      "- `a` could be `1` because `p` (which is the load of `x`) could be `0` due to the relaxed memory order and potential out-of-order execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "There exists a scenario where both `y` is `2` and `a` is `1` simultaneously:\n",
      "- `thread2` finished `y.store(2)` and loaded `x` as `0`.\n",
      "- `thread1` updates `x.store(1)` and `y.store(1)` not yet observed by `thread2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, **the assertion `assert( y != 2  || a != 1 );` can fail under relaxed memory models (TSO/PSO)**, as the expected memory write-read ordering is not enforced strictly in these models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Relaxed memory models such as TSO and PSO can affect the execution of this program by allowing out-of-order execution and visibility of memory operations. This may lead to situations where the `assert` in the main function could be violated, causing the assertion to fail, which reflects the inconsistent state introduced by relaxed memory ordering.\n",

      "    - Conditional store based on `y`’s value to `a` with a relaxed memory order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2**:\n",
      "    ```cpp\n",

      "    - `x` is then loaded with a relaxed memory order.\n",
      "    - Conditional store based on `x`’s value to `b` with a relaxed memory order.\n",

      "In the TSO memory model:\n",

      "\n",
      "- Since stores to `x` and `y` in Thread 1 must be seen in order (1 and then 1) by Thread 2, if Thread 2 writes `y = 2` and sees `x == 0`, then it likely means Thread 1 has not executed or not completed. \n",

      "Thus, under TSO, it's impossible to have `y == 2` and `a == 1` if Thread 1’s stores (`x.store(1)` and `y.store(1)`) have been correctly executed and observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO):\n",
      "In PSO, stores to different locations from the same processor can be seen out of order by other processors, though there may be some ordering guarantees for individual processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "- After `y.store(2)` in Thread 2, a fence ensures all preceding operations complete.\n",
      "- `x.load()` occurs after the fence, so it loads `x` value that Thread 1 may not have yet written (because stores from Thread 1 could be seen in any order - relaxed store to `x` might not be visible before relaxed store to `y`).\n",

      "In PSO, a scenario where Thread 2 writes `y = 2` and reads `x == 0` and then writes `a = 1` is more likely compared to TSO, since stores to `x` and `y` by Thread 1 can be observed in a different order by Thread 2.\n",

      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Under both TSO and PSO, the assertion asserts that it's impossible to see `y == 2` and `a == 1` simultaneously. However, the likelihood of observing such behavior differs since PSO allows more reordering of independent store operations, whereas TSO enforces a stricter ordering.\n",

      "2. Thread 2 stores `2` to `y`, loads from `x`, and potentially stores `1` to `a` if the loaded value from `x` is zero.\n",

      "- `x.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);` is unstable: there's no sequential ordering guaranteed here.\n",
      "- `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst);` imposes a general ordering constraint after the `x.store`.\n",
      "- `y.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);` doesn't have ordering constraints when viewed by other threads (unless they use stronger memory orders).\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the relaxed memory model, specifically `memory_order_relaxed` for store and loads, the following behavior is theoretically possible:\n",
      "- Thread 2 updates `y` to `2` without any order constraints.\n",
      "- Just after the `y.store(2)`, if `x` hasn’t been updated to `1` to be visible in Thread 2, `x.load()` may still return `0`.\n",

      "\n",
      "Thus, in this scenario:\n",
      "- `y.store(2)` could be perceived as happening before `y.store(1)` from Thread 1 due to the relaxed nature of store operations.\n",
      "- Consequently, it is possible for `y == 2` and `a == 1` simultaneously, potentially triggering the assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Considering the `assert` Statement:\n",
      "This means:\n",
      "- `assert(y != 2 || a != 1);` is checking for a condition expected to be impossible under strict sequential consistency:\n",

Let's analyze how these memory models affect the program you provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Program Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "The program consists of three threads:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1:** Sets `x` to 2 using relaxed memory order.\n",
      "2. **Thread 2:** \n",
      "   - Loads the value of `x` using relaxed memory order.\n",
      "   - Issues a sequentially consistent (SC) atomic fence.\n",
      "   - Sets `y` to 1 using relaxed memory order.\n",
      "   - If `p`, the loaded value of `x`, is 2, it sets `a` to 1 using relaxed memory order.\n",
      "3. **Thread 3:** \n",
      "   - Sets `y` to 2 using relaxed memory order.\n",
      "   - Issues a SC atomic fence.\n",
      "   - Sets `x` to 1 using relaxed memory order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main thread:\n",
      "- Creates and joins the three threads.\n",
      "- Asserts that `x` isn't 2 or `y` isn't 2 or `a` isn't 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Models Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO):**\n",
      "   - Under TSO, all threads see writes to individual memory locations in the same order but can see writes to different memory locations in different orders.\n",
      "   - This program's behavior under TSO is unpredictable. Here's an execution scenario:\n",
      "\n",
      "        - `Thread 1` writes `x = 2`.\n",
      "        - `Thread 2` reads `x = 2`.\n",
      "        - Due to the SC fence, `Thread 2`'s subsequent write to `y = 1` is visible to all threads.\n",
      "        - `Thread 3` writes `y = 2`. The SC fence forces the visibility order but does not guarantee the visibility of `y = 1`.\n",
      "        - After the fence, `Thread 3` writes `x = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "      This can still lead to:\n",
      "      - `x = 1` (as set by `Thread 3`)\n",
      "      - `y = 2` (as set by `Thread 3`)\n",
      "      - `a = 1` if `Thread 2` executes with `p = 2` before seeing `y = 2` from `Thread 3`.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Depending on timing and interleaving of the memory operations, the assertion `assert(x != 2 || y != 2 || a != 1);` could fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO):**\n",
      "   - Under PSO, writes to different memory locations are entirely unordered. This model allows even less predictability compared to TSO.\n",
      "   - In PSO, the stores to `x` and `y` can be seen in any order by other threads irrespective of the program order within each thread.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   Example sequence:\n",
      "   - `Thread 1` writes `x = 2`.\n",
      "   - `Thread 3` writes `y = 2`.\n",
      "   - `Thread 3` writes `x = 1`.\n",
      "   - `Thread 2` reads `x = 2`, then sees the SC fence and writes `y = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "   This scenario might be unlikely depending on timing but is not impossible under PSO.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Outcomes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of TSO or PSO, the program is prone to non-deterministic behavior due to the use of relaxed memory orders for the loads and stores, the non-trivial interplay between the modified variables, and the fences. In particular, any situation where both `x == 2` and `y == 2` can lead to `a` being set to 1, causing the assert condition to fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The desired assert `assert(x != 2 || y != 2 || a != 1);` aims to ensure at least one of these conditions hold:\n",
      "- `x` should not remain 2,\n",
      "- `y` should not remain 2,\n",
      "- or `a` should stay 0 if both x == 2 and y == 2 are true.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the SC fences do enforce some ordering, relaxed operations can still result in values being read or written in an order that violates the assert due to the weak guarantees provided by relaxed memory ordering. Therefore, under relaxed memory models such as TSO and PSO, the assert is not guaranteed to hold, and the program may exhibit assertion failure.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Breakdown of the Program\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization:**\n",
      "   - All atomic variables `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are initially zero.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Thread 1:**\n",
      "   - Performs `x.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed)`.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Thread 2:**\n",
      "   - Loads `x` using `p = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)`.\n",
      "   - Issues a sequentially consistent fence with `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`.\n",
      "   - Loads `y` with `q = y.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)`.\n",
      "   - If `p == 1` and `q == 0`, it stores 1 in `a` with `a.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Thread 3:**\n",
      "   - Stores 1 in `y` using `y.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed)`.\n",
      "   - Loads `x` with `r = x.load(std::memory_order_relaxed)`.\n",
      "   - If `r == 0`, it stores 1 in `b` with `b.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Main Thread:**\n",
      "   - Waits for all threads to join using `pthread_join`.\n",
      "   - Asserts that `a != 1 || b != 1` (i.e., `a == 1 && b == 1` is invalid).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Total Store Order (TSO)\n",
      "\n",
      "In TSO:\n",
      "- All stores by a single thread are observed by other threads in the same order, but loads may be reordered with respect to previous stores.\n",
      "- The operations in Thread 1 (`x.store`), Thread 2 (`x.load`, `std::atomic_thread_fence`, `y.load`), and Thread 3 (`y.store`, `x.load`) are reasoned about with respect to these orderings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Partial Store Order (PSO)\n",
      "\n",
      "In PSO:\n",
      "- There's less strict ordering, allowing significant flexibility in reordering stores to different locations.\n",
      "- Each thread may see memory operations (particularly writes) in a different order.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Model Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s analyze the possible behavior under TSO and PSO:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread Interleaving Possibility:**\n",
      "   - Thread 1 (`x.store` happens-before relationship is not guaranteed to be visible immediately due to the relaxed memory order).\n",
      "   - Thread 2 might observe `x = 1` due to Thread 1 but might not see the update to `y = 1` from Thread 3 yet.\n",
      "   - Thread 3 might store `1` to `y`, and then load `x` as `0`, indicating that the update by Thread 1 isn’t visible yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Fence Impact:**\n",
      "   - The `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)` in Thread 2 ensures a sequentially consistent scenario, but operations around relaxed stores/loads might still behave non-intuitively under relaxed models.\n",
      "   - The fence mainly impacts Thread 2's perception to ensure `p` is strictly before or after any sequentially consistent operations, but Thread 2 individually can still see `p == 1` and `q == 0`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of TSO and PSO support inter-thread visibility in a controlled but relaxed manner, meaning:\n",
      "- **It's possible for both `thread2` to see `x == 1` and `y == 0`, and `thread3` to see `y == 1` and `x == 0` simultaneously.** This situation could lead to both `a` and `b` being set to 1, violating the `assert`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Under both TSO and PSO, you cannot guarantee that `a != 1 || b != 1` will always hold true due to the relaxed ordering and visibility of stores leading to potential reordering and timing discrepancies. This makes the assertion unreliable in the presence of these relaxed memory models:\n",
      "\n",
      "```cpp\n",
      "assert(a != 1 || b != 1);  // This assertion can fail.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Discussion:\n",
      "- Under typical TSO, **stores** are seen in the same order by other threads, but **loads** can be reordered with respect to stores. This means once `x.store(2)` in `thread1` completes, `thread2` should not be able to see `p = 2` and `q = 1` because `x = 2` should be visible to all subsequent loads after `x.store(2)` completes.\n",

      "- With PSO, since **stores** from one thread can be seen out-of-order, there is a hypothetical execution where:\n",
      "  - `thread2` reads `q = 1` first, while `x` was still `1`; then\n",
      "  - `thread1` writes `x.store(2)` but due to PSO, `thread2` now sees `p = 2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, in a realistic scenario given the initial state of `x` was not explicitly set but defaultly `0`, and given no other operations, seeing `q = 1` would be infeasible.\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In both TSO and PSO scenarios:\n",
      "- The assertion `assert(a != 1);` is expected to succeed.\n",

      "### Explanation of the Program\n",
      "\n",
      "This program globally declares four atomic variables: `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`. It then launches four threads with the following behaviors:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Thread1** sets `x` to 2 and `y` to 1.\n",

      "- **Thread4** reads `y` twice and sets `b` to 1 if it observes the values 1 followed by 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the main thread asserts that both `a` and `b` are not equal to 1 simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Models and Their Effects\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**:\n",
      "    - TSO allows loads (reads) to be reordered ahead of stores (writes) but guarantees that all stores are seen in a total order.\n",
      "    - In this model, the stores performed by `Thread1` and `Thread2` will be seen in some global order by all threads.\n",
      "    - However, due to the relaxed reads of `Thread3` and `Thread4`, they may still observe values in a non-sequential manner.\n",
      "    - Even under TSO, it is possible for `Thread3` and `Thread4` to observe the sequence that makes `a` and `b` both equal to 1. For example:\n",
      "      - `Thread1` executes: `x.store(2), y.store(1)`\n",
      "      - `Thread2` executes: `y.store(2), x.store(1)`\n",
      "      - As a result:\n",
      "        - `Thread3` could observe `x` as 1 then 2.\n",
      "        - `Thread4` could also observe `y` as 1 then 2.\n",
      "    - Thus, the assertion may fail under TSO.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "    - PSO allows both loads and stores to be reordered more freely compared to TSO, as long as they don't violate program order within individual threads.\n",
      "    - The visibility of stores is less constrained in PSO, so `Thread3` and `Thread4` might see the values of `x` and `y` in more varied orders.\n",
      "    - It further increases the possibility that both `a` and `b` can become 1 since the reordering could result in:\n",
      "      - `Thread3` seeing `x` transitions from 1 to 2.\n",
      "      - `Thread4` seeing `y` transitions from 1 to 2.\n",
      "    - Thus, the assertion is even more likely to fail under PSO compared to TSO.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "In both TSO and PSO memory models, there is a significant possibility that the assertion `assert (a != 1 || b != 1)` could fail, because `Thread3` might set `a` to 1, and `Thread4` might set `b` to 1, simultaneously. \n",

      "#### Total Store Order (TSO):\n",
      "- **Memory Order Guarantees:** Ensures that all stores (writes) issued by a thread are observed in the same order by all other threads. However, loads may be reordered after subsequent stores.\n",
      "- **Effect on Program:** Since TSO generally prevents store-store reordering, the `std::atomic_thread_fence` effectively maintains order between the stores in the same thread. This means that the store to `x` in `thread1` should appear before the store to `y`, and similarly for `thread2`. Therefore, the condition `x == 2 && y == 2` should not occur, as this would require reordering contrary to the TSO guarantees. The program should be safe under TSO, and the assertion should never fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO):\n",
      "- **Memory Order Guarantees:** In PSO, store to one location can be reordered with stores to other locations. This means stores to different memory locations can be seen in different orderings by other threads.\n",
      "- **Effect on Program:** Since PSO allows store-store reordering, even in the presence of the `std::atomic_thread_fence`, `x` could be seen as `2` from `thread2` before `y` is seen as `1` from `thread1`, and vice versa for `thread2`. There is a possibility that both `thread1` and `thread2` see the stores in varying orders, i.e., `x == 2` from `thread1` and `y == 2` from `thread2`, leading to the assertion failing `assert(x != 2 || y != 2)`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "- **Under TSO:** The assertion `assert(x != 2 || y != 2)` should hold true under TSO given the `std::atomic_thread_fence` ensuring appropriate store ordering within each thread.\n",
      "- **Under PSO:** The assertion may fail because PSO allows store-store reordering across different memory locations, which can lead to both `x` and `y` being `2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the behavior of the program depends on the memory model, with TSO enforcing stricter ordering that prevents both variables from being `2` simultaneously. Meanwhile, PSO might allow such a scenario due to its relaxed store ordering constraints.\n",

      "### Relaxed Memory Models and Their Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**:\n",
      "   - Under TSO, stores (writes) are executed in program order, but loads (reads) may be executed out-of-order. Specifically, a read may be executed before an earlier store to a different location.\n",
      "   - TSO allows the following possible behavior:\n",
      "     - Thread 1: `x.store(2, memory_order_relaxed);` is executed.\n",
      "     - Thread 2: `p = x.load(memory_order_relaxed);` can read the `2` stored by Thread 1.\n",
      "     - Thread 3: `y.store(2, memory_order_relaxed);` is executed.\n",
      "     - Thread 3: `x.store(1, memory_order_relaxed);` is executed after the `y.store(2...)`.\n",
      "     - Therefore, under TSO, it is possible for `x` to be `1` at final load and `y` to be `2`. `a` will be `1` because thread 2 read `2` into `p`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "   - PSO relaxes the ordering even further compared to TSO, by allowing stores to different memory locations to be observed out-of-order. Thus, a store in one thread might be observed before another store in another thread, even though they were issued in the opposite order.\n",
      "   - PSO allows even more reordering than TSO. Thus:\n",
      "     - Thread 1: `x.store(2, memory_order_relaxed);` is executed.\n",
      "     - Thread 2: `y.store(1, memory_order_relaxed);` is executed before or after `p = x.load(memory_order_relaxed);`.\n",
      "     - Thread 3: `y.store(2, memory_order_relaxed);` and `x.store(1, memory_order_relaxed);` can be reordered.\n",
      "     - Any sequence of events where memory operations from different threads may become visible to others out-of-order is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implications for the `assert` statement\n",
      "\n",
      "The assert statement `assert(x != 2 || y != 2 || a != 1);` checks that at least one of the conditions is true. Given how relaxed memory models can reorder operations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Under TSO or PSO, it is possible that:\n",
      "   - `x` becomes `1` (last write from Thread 3).\n",
      "   - `y` becomes `2` (write from Thread 3 before the write to `x`).\n",
      "   - `a` becomes `1` if Thread 2 reads `2` from `x` before Thread 3 overwrites it with `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In **TSO** and **PSO**, reordering can lead to a condition where:\n",
      "   - `x == 1`\n",
      "   - `y == 2`\n",
      "   - `a == 1`\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, the assert `x != 2 || y != 2 || a != 1` will pass, because at least one of the conditions `x != 2`, `y != 2`, or `a != 1` will be true under these memory models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Relaxed memory ordering models (TSO and PSO) allow significant flexibility in instruction reordering. For this program, the assertion can be guaranteed to pass under these models because of the constraints defined by memory ordering, ensuring that at least one of the conditions in the assertion will hold. This eliminates the theoretical concerns of all three conditions being `2 == 2`, `2 == 2`, and `a == 1` simultaneously.\n",

      "When examining the behavior of the provided program under relaxed memory models such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), it's important to understand these models and how atomic operations interact within them.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relaxed Memory Model\n",
      "\n",
      "A relaxed memory model (like the one specified with `std::memory_order_relaxed`) allows certain reorderings of read and write operations. Specifically, operations on different atomic variables are not automatically synchronized with each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Total Store Order (TSO)\n",
      "\n",
      "TSO is a memory consistency model where:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Writes from a single processor are seen by all processors in order.\n",
      "2. Reads by a single processor can be reordered with previous writes from that processor (store buffering).\n",
      "3. Writes are not reordered with other writes (i.e., writes are not out of order).\n",
      "\n",
      "In your example:\n",
      "- `thread1` reads `x` and then writes `x`.\n",
      "- `thread2` writes `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given TSO rules, the write of `x` to 2 in `thread2` must happen before the write of `x` to 1 in `thread1` if `p` is observed to be 2 (as read happens before write in `thread1`). But since operations are relaxed, the reads and writes can be perceived out of order between threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Partial Store Order (PSO)\n",
      "\n",
      "PSO is a bit more relaxed than TSO, allowing writes to be observed out-of-order across different processors. Key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Writes from a single processor can be observed in different orders by other processors.\n",
      "2. Reads can still be reordered with previous writes from the same processor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this relaxed consistency in PSO, reads and writes to `x` and `a` can be reordered even more freely across threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis of the Program\n",
      "\n",
      "Under relaxed memory orders, you are checking if the assertion `assert (a!=1 || x!=2)` can ever fail. Here’s the potential execution scenario to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. `thread2` writes `x = 2`.\n",
      "2. `thread1` reads `p = x` which gets the value 2.\n",
      "3. According to the code, since `p == 2`, `a` is set to 1.\n",
      "4. After that, `thread1` writes `x = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we can have `x = 1` after both threads have completed, and `a = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these operations:\n",
      "- If `thread2` writes `x = 2` and `thread1` reads it immediately, then proceeds to write `x = 1`.\n",
      "- Then `a` can indeed be set to 1, but the value of `x` might end up as 1 eventually due to the write in `thread1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Under both TSO and PSO, due to the relaxed operations, it is possible for the final state to be `x = 1` and `a = 1`, satisfying the assertion `assert (a!=1 || x!=2)`. Under these memory models, the atomic operations with relaxed order might reorder in such a way where:\n",
      "- `a` is 1 because `p` was 2 at some point.\n",
      "- `x` ends up being set back to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the assertion correctly upholds in typical relaxed behaviors and will not fail. Relaxed models allow these operations to be non-intuitive but still consistent with the assertion after `pthread_join`.\n",

      "4. **Thread4:** Reads `x` twice and stores `1` to `b` if the first read is `2` and second read is `1`, stores `2` to `b` otherwise if the first is `1` and second is `2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The program then verifies that `a` and `b` are not simultaneously set to `1`, and they are not simultaneously set to `2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact of Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      " \n",
      "In a fully sequentially consistent (SC) memory model, operations appear to execute in the exact order specified by the program. However, in TSO and PSO:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **TSO (Total Store Order):** Store operations to different memory locations can be reordered, but loads will execute in program order. Stores may be seen by other processors in a different order. For loads and stores to the same memory location, operations will be seen in program order.\n",
      "- **PSO (Partial Store Order):** Both loads and stores can be reordered, and stores to the same or different locations can be seen in a different order by different threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the given program:\n",
      "- All operations on `x` are performed using `std::memory_order_relaxed`. This means there are no synchronization guarantees on the order of these operations.\n",
      "- Therefore, the reads and writes of `x` might happen in any order, which can lead to non-deterministic behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Execution Sequences\n",
      "Given `x.store(1)` and `x.store(2)` executed by Thread1 and Thread2 respectively, and considering that these stores and subsequent loads in Thread3 and Thread4 are relaxed, we can observe different interleavings:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Potential Issue: `assert` Condition Violated**\n",
      "    - Assume Thread1 and Thread2 write to `x` such that Thread3 reads `1` first and then `2`, setting `a` to `1`.\n",
      "    - Simultaneously, Thread4 might read `2` first and then `1`, setting `b` to `1`.\n",
      "    - This situation violates the condition `( a != 1 || b != 1) ` since both `a` and `b` are `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Another Potential Issue: `assert` Condition Violated**\n",
      "    - Assume another scenario where Thread3 reads `2` first and then `1`, setting `a` to `2`.\n",
      "    - Meanwhile, Thread4 might read `1` first and then `2`, setting `b` to `2`.\n",
      "    - This violates the condition `(a != 2 || b != 2)` since both `a` and `b` are `2`.\n",
      "\n",

      "Given the relaxed memory model and the lack of synchronization between the threads on `x`, the assertion in the `main` function can indeed be violated.

      "`std::memory_order_relaxed` merely ensures atomicity of individual operations but does not establish any ordering guarantees between them. Consequently, loads and stores can be reordered freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Reorderings and Implications\n",
      "\n",
      "The key interactions to understand are:\n",
      "- How and when `x` and `y` are written by Thread 1.\n",
      "- How and when `x` and `y` are read and written by Thread 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Total Store Order (TSO)\n",
      "\n",
      "**TSO** generally allows a load to be reordered with a subsequent store, but stores are typically observed in the same order by other processors. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible scenario:**\n",
      "1. Thread 1:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - `x.store(2)`\n",
      "    - `y.store(1)`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Thread 2:\n",
      "   \n",
      "    - `p = y.load()` sees `y == 1` (after Thread 1 executes `y.store(1)`)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - `x.store(1)` (overwrites the `2` stored by Thread 1)\n",
      "  \n",
      "    - Since `p == 1`, `a.store(1)`\n",
      "\n",
      "In this sequence, the assertion `assert (x != 2 || a != 1)` will hold.\n",
      "  \n",
      "**Another scenario** happens because `std::memory_order_relaxed` allows loads and stores to be reordered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Thread 1 stores become visible:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - `x.store(2)` => `x = 2`\n",
      "    - `y.store(1)` => `y = 1`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Thread 2:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - `p = y.load()` sees `1`\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - before `x.store(1)` executes in Thread 2, the assertion is checked in the main thread,\n",
      "  \n",
      "    - Assertion `assert(x != 2 || a != 1)` will fail if `x == 2` (yet unobserved by Thread 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Partial Store Order (PSO)\n",
      "\n",
      "**PSO** allows more degrees of freedom by allowing both stores and loads to be reordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Thread 1 can forward `y.store(1)` as seen by Thread 2 before `x.store(2)`, then:\n",
      "1. Thread 2 might see:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - Thread 1 executes `y.store`, hence `p = y.load()` sees `y = 1`\n",
      "    - Thread 2 executes `x.store(1)`\n",
      "    - since `p == 1`, `a.store(1)`\n",
      "\n",
      "    However, by the time the assertion checks in the main thread:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - Thread 1's `x.store(2)` visible only at last,\n",
      "    - Assertion `assert (x != 2 || a != 1)` will fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In both TSO and PSO relaxed memory models:\n",
      "\n",
      "- There exists a scenario where the program order of writes to `x` and `y` in Thread 1, and reads from `y` in Thread 2 combined with write to `x` would lead to `assert(x != 2 || a != 1)` failing.\n",
      "  \n",
      "**Fundamental Cause**: No synchronization primitives enforce required ordering—using `std::memory_order_relaxed` permits reordering leading to assertion check potential failure.\n",

Since `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)` imposes a global ordering point, updates to `x` and `y` will be visible in order across all threads. This means that an inconsistent state (like `x` reading as `1` then `2` in Thread 3) is unlikely to happen because the store order is maintained.\n",
      "\n",

      "### Memory Ordering in Relaxed Memory Models:\n",
      "- `std::memory_order_relaxed` allows operations to be freely reordered.\n",
      "- `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)` creates a full memory fence, ensuring sequential consistency around the fence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analyzing Based on Relaxed Memory Models:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Possible Execution Order:\n",
      "1. **Thread 1 (thread1):** sets `x = 2`\n",
      "2. **Thread 2 (thread2):** \n",
      "    - Reads `p = x` (which could be 2 if `thread1` executes before this point)\n",

      "    - Sets `y = 1`\n",
      "    - Since `p == 2`, sets `a = 1`\n",
      "3. **Thread 3 (thread3):**\n",
      "    - Sets `y = 2`\n",
      "    - Sets `x = 1`\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this sequence, more variations exist because of relaxed ordering:\n",

      "#### Key Interleavings:\n",
      "- `Thread 1` may set `x = 2` either before or after operations in `Thread 3`.\n",
      "- `Thread 2` may read the old or new value of `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### TSO and PSO Relaxed Models:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### TSO (Total Store Order):\n",
      "- This maintains a stronger ordering than relaxed but still allows some reordering.\n",
      "- Under TSO, stores can be delayed, but loads cannot bypass earlier stores to the same location.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### PSO (Partial Store Order):\n",
      "- This allows even weaker ordering where stores to different locations can be reordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Critical Scenarios:\n",
      "1. **Under TSO:**\n",
      "   - `Thread 1`'s `x.store(2)` ensures `p` in `Thread 2` likely reads `2`.\n",
      "   - The fence ensures no reordering of loads/stores across it (`y.store(1)` and `a.store(1)` are well ordered).\n",
      "   - However, `Thread 3` may overwrite `y` to `2` before/after `Thread 2`'s operations.\n",
      "   - If `Thread 3` reads old value of `x`, it does not affect the condition in the assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Under PSO:**\n",
      "   - Greater freedom with reordering, `Thread 1` and `Thread 3` may not be synchronized as tightly.\n",
      "   - `Thread 3` can store `y = 2` before `Thread 2` executes, allowing `x` to be `1` later.\n",
      "   - Assertions hold under different timings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "- The assertion `assert(x != 2 || y != 2 || a != 1);` essentially ensures that the alignment of variable values making `x == 2 && y == 2 && a == 1` be impossible when relaxed orderings are used.\n",

      "### Key Observations in the Code\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Threads and Operations:**\n",
      "   - `thread1` sets `x` to `1` and `y` to `2`.\n",
      "   - `thread2` sets `y` to `3` and `x` to `4`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Atomic Operations:**\n",
      "   - Both threads are using `std::memory_order_relaxed`, which means that reads and writes of these atomic variables can be reordered freely. There's no synchronization enforced beyond atomicity, so the operations can appear in any order to both threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Assertion:**\n",
      "   - The assertion `assert(x != 2 || y != 3);` checks that not both `x` is `2` and `y` is `3` simultaneously after both threads have finished execution. The goal of this assertion is to verify that it is not possible for both `x == 2` and `y == 3` to happen at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Effects of Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Total Store Order (TSO):**\n",
      "  TSO is a common architecture memory model where stores (writes) are seen in order by all threads. It allows some reordering among loads and stores, but it guarantees that if one thread's store is visible to another thread, it appears in the order it was issued.\n",
      "\n",
      "  With TSO, the possible interleavings of thread execution do not allow `x` to see the value `2` (set by `thread1`) and `y` to see `3` (set by `thread2`) because writes would happen in a consistent order across threads. Thus, if the assertion is in effect, it would likely hold true unless both threads fail in a certain way. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Partial Store Order (PSO):**\n",
      "  PSO allows even more flexibility particularly with respect to the visibility and ordering of writes to different locations. In scenarios where PSO is implemented, one thread may observe the writes of another in a more relaxed manner, allowing the possibility that:\n",
      "  - `thread1` finishes writing `y` as `2`, making `y` visible to `thread2`.\n",
      "  - `thread2` might subsequently write `x` as `4`, making both `x` and `y` appear to simultaneously have the values `2` and `3`, respectively, leading to `assert(x != 2 || y != 3)` possibly failing.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the above considerations with regards to relaxed memory models:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **On TSO**: The assertion is likely to hold as it imposes a total visibility on the writes by different threads, preventing the simultaneous states leading to the assertion failure.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **On PSO**: The assertion could fail due to the significant flexibility of reordering in write visibility caused by the lack of guarantees across different locations, allowing one thread's operations to become visible before the other's, thus allowing states where `x` can be `2` and `y` can be `3`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The relaxed operations mean that threads are not guaranteed to see each other’s writes immediately; hence there exists a risk of arriving at a state that leads to an assertion failure, especially in environments with more permissive memory models.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Program Breakdown\n",
      "1. **Thread 1**:\n",
      "   - Stores `1` into the atomic variable `x`.\n",
      "   - Loads the value of `x` into `p`.\n",
      "   - If `p` is `2`, it stores `1` into the atomic variable `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2**:\n",
      "   - Stores `2` into the atomic variable `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Interaction Between Threads\n",
      "Both threads access the shared variable `x` without synchronization beyond atomic operations. The `atomic` type ensures that individual read and write operations are atomic but does not enforce any specific ordering between the threads beyond atomic guarantees.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Models:\n",
      "#### Total Store Order (TSO):\n",
      "- In TSO, a processor only sees writes in the order they were issued (total order). This means that if Thread 1 stores `1` and then loads `x`, it will \"see\" that `x` holds `1` if the writes from itself are completed before reads.\n",
      "- However, TSO allows the threads to see operations in their local order but may allow other threads to observe writes to `x` from `thread2` (the store of `2`) after `thread1` has performed its store. \n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO):\n",
      "- Under PSO, the writes made by each thread may not be directly visible to other threads in the order they were made. This allows for more reordering of writes than TSO, and consequently, it could lead to situations where thread1 can see `x` as `1`, but still `thread2` has already written `2` to `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis:\n",
      "Given the relaxed memory order:\n",
      "1. **Store of `1` by Thread 1** will happen before the read (`p = x.load(...)`), but it does not guarantee that other threads will see `1` immediately if they have stored after it.\n",
      "2. Because of the relaxed semantics:\n",
      "   - Thread 2's store of `2` may occur before thread 1's load operation is executed, leading to the possibility that `p` may be observed as `2` by thread 1.\n",
      "   - If `p == 2`, then the store to `a` happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact on Assertion:\n",
      "The assertion `assert( x != 1 || a != 1);` is meant to confirm that it's impossible for `x` to be `1` while `a` is `1`, given possible interleavings. However, due to the relaxed store semantics, under certain conditions, `x` may end up being `2` still after the operations, allowing `assert` to pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "In relaxed memory models:\n",
      "- There exists a potential that `p` can become `2` due to the relaxed store orders. This makes it possible to assert `x` may never return to `1` by the time `a` is `1`, allowing the assertion to possibly go through successfully, despite its logical intent.\n",
      "- This leads to potentially undefined behavior or inconsistent results based on the exact timing of the thread executions, which makes the assertion valid from a theoretical standpoint but practically unreliable due to the nature of relaxed memory operations.\n",

      "### Overview of the Program\n",
      "\n",
      "The program initializes three threads, each performing operations on shared atomic variables `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`. Here's a brief outline of the thread operations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Thread 1**: Sets `x` to `1`.\n",
      "- **Thread 2**: Loads `x` and then attempts to load `y` (after a sequentially consistent fence). If `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`, it sets `a` to `1`.\n",
      "- **Thread 3**: Sets `y` to `1` (followed by a sequentially consistent fence) and checks `x`. If `x` is `0`, it sets `b` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the main function, after joining the threads, an assertion checks that if `y` is `2`, then `a` is not `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "**Total Store Order (TSO)** and **Partial Store Order (PSO)** affect how memory operations are perceived by different threads:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**: Enforces a total ordering on store operations. It allows loads and stores to be observed in the order they were issued by a single thread. However, loads from one thread may be reordered with respect to stores from another thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**: Similar to TSO, but may allow more freedom in terms of how stores can be seen by other threads. PSO permits a degree of reordering that allows loads/stores to have less stringent visibility compared to TSO.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact on the Program Behavior\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the relaxed ordering and the atomic operations in your program, let's analyze potential execution scenarios:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Thread 1** writes `1` to `x`.\n",
      "- **Thread 2** reads `x` after Thread 1 has executed. If there's any inter-thread delay before Thread 1's store becomes visible to Thread 2, Thread 2 may read a stale value, which is where memory models come into play.\n",
      "- **Thread 2** only sets `a` if it observes `x` as `1` and `y` as `0`. Since `y` is uninitialized, its value is indeterminate until it's set by Thread 3.\n",
      "- **Thread 3** sets `y` to `1` but checks `x` after a sequentially consistent fence. Depending on the inter-thread timing and memory model effects, Thread 3 could see `x` as `0` if Thread 1's store is delayed (or not visible).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Behavior Considerations Under Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "- In scenarios where TSO or PSO allow the threads to see the most recent writes at different times due to relaxations:\n",
      "  - It's conceivable for Thread 2 to observe `x` as `1` and `y` as `0` if it runs after Thread 1 successfully completes but before Thread 3 updates `y`.\n",
      "  - Conversely, `Thread 3` might read `x` as `0` if for some reason, the store by Thread 1 has not been observed by Thread 3 yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "These scenarios imply that you could potentially hit the condition where `a` becomes `1` (in Thread 2) while `b` does not get set (due to the condition in Thread 3) after Thread 3 sees `x` as `0` despite `x` being set to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, under relaxed memory models like TSO and PSO, the complex interactions can potentially lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, the conditions in the threads may not be fully synchronized due to the presence of relaxed memory operations, leading to scenarios where:\n",
      "- `y` can be `2` but `a` is `1`, which would violate the assertion in the `main()` function if this were to occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "This illustrates the critical importance of memory order in multi-threaded programming, especially when working with shared variables. It emphasizes the necessity to understand and, when possible, control the visibility of writes across threads to avoid race conditions.\n",

      "1. **Thread 1** sets `x` to 1 and then, via a sequentially consistent fence, ensures that all previous writes (to `x`) are visible before writing `1` to `y`.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "3. The assertion at the end checks the condition `y != 2 || a != 1`. This translates to: either `y` must not have been set to `2` or `a` must have been set to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Behavior Under Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Total Store Order (TSO)\n",
      "In TSO, we have the following characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Writes to the same address are serialized in a total order as observed by all threads.\n",
      "- Sequential consistency is often maintained, thus providing a stronger guarantee about the order of operations.\n",
      "- Consequently, the program is likely to exhibit the expected behavior where:\n",
      "  \n",
      "  - If `y` becomes `2`, `x` should also not be `0` when `a` is incremented, thereby allowing the assertion to hold true, preventing the invalid state of `y = 2` and `a = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given TSO's nature, it would be unusual for `y` to be `2` while `x` is read as `0` if both threads have executed their operations in an expected manner as per the sequential consistency due to the fences.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO)\n",
      "In PSO, the properties are weaker:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Store operations may not be observed in the same order by all threads.\n",
      "- Depending on how the execution is scheduled, it is possible for the following to happen: \n",
      "  - `y` is set to `2` before `x` has been set to `1` by thread 1 due to possible re-ordering.\n",
      "  - Thread 2 may see `x` as `0` even after `y` is set to `2`.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Thus, in PSO, it is feasible for the program to satisfy the condition of the assertion where `y` is `2` and `a` is subsequently set to `1` due to the read of `x` seeing it as `0`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "- **With TSO**, one can expect the assertion `y != 2 || a != 1` to typically hold true due to stronger guarantees around the ordering of operations.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **With PSO**, one may find scenarios where the assertion fails because the writes from one thread may not be perceived in the same order by the other thread, enabling `y` to be `2` while `x` appears to be `0`, which would lead to `a` being set to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, relaxed memory models introduce complexities related to visibility and ordering that significantly affect multi-threaded program outcomes. In this case, TSO ensures stronger synchronization, whereas PSO can expose the program to potential violations of the assertion, depending on the execution context.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Program Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The program consists of two threads:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1** writes `1` to `x` and `1` to `y` using relaxed memory order.\n",
      "2. **Thread 2** writes `2` to `y`, reads from `x`, and potentially writes `1` to `a` based on the value read from `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key operations are:\n",
      "- Thread 1's actions can be summarized as:\n",
      "  - `x = 1`\n",
      "  - `y = 1`\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Thread 2's actions:\n",
      "  - `y = 2`\n",
      "  - `p = x` (where it reads the value of `x`)\n",
      "  - If `p == 0`, then `a = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the `assert` in `main` checks that if `y` is `2`, then `a` must not be `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Effects of Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Total Store Order (TSO)\n",
      "TSO allows writes to be seen by reads in a sequentially consistent order but may permit out-of-order execution of writes. In TSO:\n",
      "- Thread 1's writes to `x` and `y` are likely seen by Thread 2 after both writes complete.\n",
      "- Thread 2 would only see `y` as `2` after it has finished executing its write operations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the operations, the following could happen in a TSO context:\n",
      "1. Thread 1 writes `1` to `x`, then writes `1` to `y`.\n",
      "2. Thread 2 writes `2` to `y`, reads `x`,\n",
      "3. If Thread 2 reads `x` after Thread 1 has completed its writes, it may see `1`.\n",
      "4. Hence, `p` will not be `0`, and `a` will not be written to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the assertion would hold true because `y` can be `2`, but `a` cannot be `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO)\n",
      "PSO allows certain store operations from the same thread to be seen in different orders by other threads. This means that if Thread 1 executes:\n",
      "- Write to `x` (`x = 1`)\n",
      "- Write to `y` (`y = 1`)\n",
      "The writes may be observed in varying orders depending on the interleaving of the threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "1. Thread 2 could see `y` as `2` (after its write) before it sees the write to `x`, which could still be `0`.\n",
      "2. This could happen if:\n",
      "   - Thread 2 executes the write to `2` in `y`\n",
      "   - Then reads `x` before Thread 1 has updated it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this scenario, if Thread 2 reads `0` for `x`, it will proceed to update `a` to `1`, leading to a contradiction in the assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Under relaxed memory models:\n",
      "- TSO generally maintains more predictable behavior (which may not allow `a` to be `1` when `y` is `2`).\n",
      "- PSO introduces greater ambiguity, potentially allowing `y` to be `2` while `p` reads `0`, thus leading `a` to be `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, under PSO, there exists a potential for the assertion to fail, as the conditions can allow for `y == 2` and `a == 1`. Under TSO, the assertion is more likely to hold true due to the enforcement of read/write ordering.\n",

      "### Overview of Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**:\n",
      "   - Under TSO, writes from a thread are visible to that thread in the order they were issued, but there can be a reordering of writes to different memory locations or reads from different threads.\n",
      "   - Memory writes may be visible to others only after the completion of all preceding writes of the same thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "   - In PSO, operations can be reordered in more flexible ways compared to TSO. For instance, one thread may see writes made by another thread in a non-sequential order.\n",
      "   - A thread can also read a variable before all store operations from the other thread are visible if the operations do not \"conflict\" in terms of the variables being modified.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analyzing the Code\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s analyze the program given the memory models.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread Execution**:\n",
      "    - `thread1` performs:\n",
      "        - `x.store(1)` followed by a fence (`std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`) and then reads `y`.\n",
      "        - If `y` is 0, it stores `1` to `a`.\n",
      "    - `thread2` does the opposite:\n",
      "        - `y.store(1)` followed by a fence (`std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`) and then reads `x`.\n",
      "        - If `x` is 0, it stores `1` to `b`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Behavior under Relaxed Models**:\n",
      "    - Since `x` and `y` are written and read with `std::memory_order_relaxed`, there are no synchronization guarantees about when `x` becomes visible to `thread2` after `thread1` writes to `x` and vice versa for `y`.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - The `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)` ensures that operations before it in the program cannot be reordered to appear after it, but it does not provide mutual visibility guarantees across threads without further synchronization.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "- Under such relaxed models, the following situation can occur:\n",
      "    - `thread1` executes its store to `x`, then the fence, and reads `y` before `thread2` executes its store to `y` or its store might not yet be visible.\n",
      "    - Conversely, `thread2` might see `y` as `1` if it executes after `thread1` has stored `1` to `y`, but `thread1` might still read `y` as `0`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Effects on Assertion\n",
      "\n",
      "The assertion `assert ( a != 1 || b != 1 );` is crucial:\n",
      "- The program assumes that both `a` and `b` cannot simultaneously be `1`, which represents a logical consistency in the operations derived from the reads of `x` and `y`. \n",
      "\n",
      "- Due to relaxed memory ordering (TSO or PSO), it is possible that:\n",
      "    - `thread1` reads `y` as `0` (because `y` may not have been updated yet) and thus sets `a` to `1`.\n",
      "    - Simultaneously, if `thread2` also has a scenario where it sees `x` as `0`, it would set `b` to `1`.\n",
      "  \n",
      "This would violate the expected behavior defined by the `assert`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, relaxed memory models like TSO and PSO allow for various outcomes and interleavings of operations that could lead to both `a` and `b` being set to `1`, thus violating the assertion. Hence, the assertion in the code might fail due to such reordering enabled by the relaxed memory operations, demonstrating how intricate thread interactions can lead to unexpected behaviors when synchronization is not robustly enforced.\n",

      "   \n",
      "2. **Thread Functions**:\n",
      "   - `thread1` stores `1` to `x`, then reads `y`, and if `y` is `0`, it sets `a` to `1`.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Points\n",
      "\n",
      "* The issue to investigate is whether thread 2 can see `x` as `0` after it has been written to by thread 1.\n",
      "* The assert at the end ensures that if `y == 2`, then `a` must not be `1`. This implies that if thread 2 successfully sees `x` as `0`, then thread 1 must not have executed its stores before thread 2's load.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Models and Their Effects\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO):**\n",
      "   - Under TSO, loads and stores are generally seen in the order they were issued by a single thread, but different threads can observe them in different orders based on the timing of the operations and the fences.\n",
      "   - The sequentially consistent fence in thread 2 creates a synchronization point that ensures all preceding stores (within thread 2) are visible to subsequent loads (in thread 2) and to other threads that synchronize with it.\n",
      "   - In this case, the memory operations will respect the \"happens-before\" relationship, and the assert should generally hold true, i.e., if `y` is `2`, `a` should not be `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO):**\n",
      "   - In a Partial Store Order model, a store from one thread may be delayed and not immediately visible to other threads. In the worst-case scenario with these relaxed models, operations can become out of sync in a way that can lead to race conditions.\n",
      "   - With PSO, it is possible for thread 2 to write `y = 2`, then check `x`, and see `0` even after thread 1 has run, because there is a lack of guarantees on the ordering of stores and loads across different threads.\n",
      "   - Here, it might allow thread 2 to see `x` as `0` when it checks after thread 1 has run, potentially violating the assert.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The key effect of relaxed memory models on this program is that they can lead to situations where thread 2 can see `x` as `0` after thread 1 has executed its stores. Under TSO, it is unlikely for `y` to equal `2` and for `a` to equal `1` due to the guarantees around memory operations in a more sequentially consistent manner. However, under PSO, race conditions might occur that could allow the assert to fail. \n",
      "\n",
      "This difference highlights the importance of understanding the implications of the memory model being used when developing concurrent programs, as it can lead to different observable behaviors and potential bugs.

      "### Program Breakdown:\n",
      "1. **Thread 1**:\n",
      "    - Sets `x` to `1` with `store` (relaxed) - no memory synchronization is enforced.\n",
      "    - Issues a sequential consistency fence - ensures that all previous writes (in this case only `x.store`), are made visible before proceeding.\n",
      "    - Sets `y` to `1` with `store` (relaxed) - this write is still affected by the previous fence.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2**:\n",
      "    - Sets `y` to `2` with `store` (relaxed) - no memory synchronization is enforced.\n",
      "    - Loads the value of `x` with `load` (relaxed).\n",
      "    - If the loaded value of `x` is `0`, it sets `a` to `1` (relaxed).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Models:\n",
      "- **Total Store Order (TSO)** allows loads to be reordered before earlier stores, but not after. It retains a global order on memory writes that ensures a visibility semantics is preserved.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Partial Store Order (PSO)** is more permissive, allowing even more aggressive reordering compared to TSO. It mostly applies to multi-threading systems where stores can be locally reordered unless explicitly prevented by synchronization operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis of the Relaxed Model Behavior:\n",
      "1. **Under TSO**:\n",
      "   - Thread 1 successfully executes `x = 1` and orders its operations because of the sequential consistency fence before `y = 1`.\n",
      "   - Thread 2 can still write `y = 2` and read `x`. However, due to the fence in Thread 1 and the guarantees of TSO, if Thread 1 has completed its store to `y`, then `y` will see the latest write from Thread 1 before executing its own read from `x`.\n",
      "   - As a result, `p` will read `1`, and thus `a` will not be set to `1`. The assertion will hold, meaning `y != 2 || a != 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Under PSO**:\n",
      "   - Thread 1 performs `x.store(1)` and then `y.store(1)`, while Thread 2 performs its operations without the constraint of TSO.\n",
      "   - Thread 2 can write `y = 2` and read `x`. There is a possibility in this relaxed model that Thread 2 sees the write `y = 2` before the write `x = 1` from Thread 1 if the writes are reordered. Consequently, if Thread 2 executes after `y` is set to `2` but before Thread 1's write of `x` has completed, it could read `x` as `0` and thus `a` could be set to `1`.\n",
      "   - This means it's possible for the assertion `y != 2 || a != 1` to fail if `a` becomes `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Under relaxed memory models like PSO, the behavior can lead to an assertion failure (`y == 2 && a == 1`) due to potential reordering. Under strict memory models like TSO, the assertion is likely to hold. Therefore, using relaxed memory operations without proper synchronization leads to unpredictable and potentially erroneous behavior.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Effects of Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Total Store Order (TSO)\n",
      "In a system with TSO, the stores from each thread will appear in the order they were issued, with respect to each thread. The main implications for the program are:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The memory fence in `thread2` ensures that the read of `x` occurs before the write to `y`. This helps in synchronizing operations across threads. \n",
      "- Since `thread1` writes `2` to `x`, it is possible for `thread2` to see the value `2` in `p` (i.e., when it reads `x` before any other stores).\n",
      "- The assert `assert(x != 2 || y != 2 || a != 1);` can potentially fail if `p` sees `2` and `thread2` executes before `thread3` updates `x` or `y`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO) \n",
      "PSO may allow for more relaxed behaviors because it permits the reordering of writes to the same variable in certain contexts. This means:\n",
      "\n",
      "- In a PSO system, `thread3`'s write to `y` may not be observed before the `thread2` writes `1` to `a`, even if the read of `x` in `thread2` should happen after the write to `y`.\n",
      "- Depending on timing, `thread2` could possibly see the `y` value as `1` before it sees the `x` value updated to `1`, thereby satisfying the assert if conditions align accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The combination of relaxed memory orders and the execution timing of the threads can lead to unexpected behavior in the program. In particular, with the inclusion of potential reordering, it's easy to imagine situations under both TSO and PSO where the assert could fail due to the visibility rules dictated by the memory model. As such, it's crucial to carefully handle multithreaded interactions, particularly in the context of relaxed memory models, to avoid race conditions or unintended results. \n",
      "\n",

Let's break down the effects of relaxed memory models like Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) on the behavior of this program.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Models Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**: \n",
      "   - TSO ensures that all stores are visible to a thread in the order they were issued. However, loads can be reordered with respect to other loads. It allows reordering of reads, but not of writes.\n",
      "   - In TSO, if one thread writes to a variable and another thread reads from that variable, the write is guaranteed to be seen by the reader only after all previous writes in that thread are completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "   - PSO is more relaxed than TSO in that it allows more freedom with the ordering of stores and loads. However, there may still be some restrictions to ensure certain guarantees.\n",
      "   - PSO allows loads to see earlier stores from the same thread, while permitting some degree of reordering between threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analyzing the Threads\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1 (`thread1`)**:\n",
      "   - Writes `1` to `x`. This operation is done with `memory_order_relaxed`, which does not impose any ordering guarantees with respect to other threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2 (`thread2`)**:\n",
      "   - Loads `x` and stores the value in `p`.\n",
      "   - It then introduces a full memory barrier (`std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`), which ensures that all previous operations (loads/stores) in the current thread are completed before any operations following the fence are started.\n",
      "   - It subsequently loads `y` into `q`. \n",
      "   - If `p` is equal to `1` and `q` is equal to `0`, it writes `1` to `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thread 3 (`thread3`)**:\n",
      "   - Writes `1` to `y` and then loads `x` into `r`.\n",
      "   - If `r` is equal to `0`, it writes `1` to `b`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Behaviors in Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "- If we consider relaxed memory models:\n",
      "  - There is no guarantee that the write to `x` in `thread1` is visible to `thread2` before `thread2` reads `x`.\n",
      "  - Therefore, `p` could be `0` in `thread2` even after `thread1` writes to `x`, allowing `thread2` to not set `a` to `1`.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- Similarly, since `thread3` also writes to `y` and then reads `x`, `r` could be `0`. Thus, `b` might be set to `1` by `thread3`, leading to the possibility of `a` being `1` and `b` being `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Asserting the Behavior\n",
      "\n",
      "The assertion `assert(a != 1 || b != 1);` checks to ensure that not both `a` and `b` can be `1` simultaneously. \n",
      "\n",
      "In relaxed memory models:\n",
      "- Given the non-deterministic execution order, it’s possible that both assertions can be violated if:\n",
      "  - `thread1` sets `x` to `1`, `thread2` reads that value after the fence, sets `a` to `1`, and at the same time, `thread3` reads `x` before `thread1` runs, leading to `b` being set to `1` as well. \n",
      "- This would break the assertion `a != 1 || b != 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "To sum it up, in relaxed memory models like TSO or PSO:\n",
      "- The behavior of the program is non-deterministic.\n",
      "- The assertion may fail because the relaxed memory semantics allow reordering and visibility issues across threads.\n",
      "- The outcome relies heavily on the timing of thread execution and the memory visibility effects of relaxed memory operations without any strong synchronization constructs.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Program Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Global Variables**:\n",
      "   - `atomic_int x`: initialized to 0.\n",
      "   - `atomic_int a`: also initialized to 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread Functions**:\n",
      "   - **Thread 1** (`thread1`): This thread sets `x` to 2 using a relaxed store operation.\n",
      "   - **Thread 2** (`thread2`): This thread reads the value of `x` twice. It checks if the first read (`p`) equals 2 and if the second read (`q`) equals 1. If both conditions are true, it sets `a` to 1 using a relaxed store operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Flow\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Thread Creation**: The `main` function starts two threads.\n",
      "- **Thread 1** sets `x` to 2.\n",
      "- **Thread 2** attempts to read `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Relaxed Memory Order**: The `memory_order_relaxed` option allows operations on the atomic variable to occur without any synchronization with other threads, meaning that operations can be completed out of order, leading to a potential lack of visibility regarding the order of operations in concurrent contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Race Conditions**: Because both threads access `x` without any synchronization constraints, Thread 2 can potentially read different values from `x` during its two reads due to race conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Memory Model Effects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**:\n",
      "   - In a system with TSO, a thread would see all preceding stores by all threads in a single, linear order. However, the relaxed model used here allows Thread 2 to read `x` at different times and potentially observe different values. Because of this relaxed memory model, it could read `x` as both 2 and 1 (i.e., `p == 2` and `q == 1`).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "   - A partial store order allows the visibility of writes to be reordered; as a result, it is possible even in this model for Thread 2 to first see `p` as 2 and then later see `q` as 1. Because of the independent nature of the loads, Thread 2 could read stale values of `x` due to its relaxed operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reliability of Assertion:\n",
      "\n",
      "The assertion `assert ( a != 1);` in the main function means that the program expects `a` to be 0 at the end of execution. However, due to the behavior described:\n",
      "\n",
      "- It is indeed possible for Thread 2 to see `p` as 2 (when `x` was set by Thread 1) and then later read `q` as 1 if Thread 1 has already completed but had not updated the visibility of `x` consistently across all threads yet — creating a situation where condition `(p == 2) && (q == 1)` is satisfied.\n",
      "- The assertion may therefore fail due to the concurrency effects introduced by relaxed memory models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In relaxed memory models, especially with operations enforced with `memory_order_relaxed`, there is no guarantee of order or visibility for operations between threads. Thus, programs like the one above can produce unexpected results, including the assertion failing, due to race conditions on the variable `x`, demonstrating how relaxed memory ordering significantly impacts multi-threaded program behavior.\n",

      "\n",
      "In both cases, relaxed memory models can lead to behaviors that seem counterintuitive due to the absence of strong synchronization guarantees.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Program and Its Threads\n",
      "\n",
      "The given program involves four threads:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1**: Sets `x` to 2 and `y` to 1.\n",
      "2. **Thread 2**: Sets `y` to 2 and `x` to 1.\n",
      "3. **Thread 3**: Loads `x` twice and checks if it sees values 1 followed by 2.\n",
      "4. **Thread 4**: Loads `y` twice and checks if it sees values 1 followed by 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final assertion checks that both `a` and `b` are not equal to 1 together. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Outcomes with Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Visibility and Value Reordering**:\n",
      "   - Due to the relaxed memory models, the reads in `thread3` and `thread4` may not see the writes from `thread1` and `thread2` in the order they were issued.\n",
      "   - For instance, thread 3 may load `x` and see `1` followed by `2`, potentially due to the operations in `thread1` and `thread2` executed in an unexpected order, where the values written by `thread2` did not propagate through the memory in the observable order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Execution Scenarios**:\n",
      "   - It’s possible for both `thread3` and `thread4` to obtain the values that satisfy both conditions (`p == 1` and `q == 2`) if the writes from `thread2` were seen before or otherwise became visible in a way that confuses the reads.\n",
      "   - In a TSO or PSO context, it’s conceivable for `thread2` to complete after `thread3` has started executing — actually, `thread2` may write `x = 1` while `thread3` sees it as `x = 2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **A Violation of Assertion**:\n",
      "   - The assertion `assert (a != 1 || b != 1);` is designed to ensure that not both `a` and `b` can be set to 1 simultaneously.\n",
      "   - However, due to the relaxed memory model, it is feasible that both threads 3 and 4 can read values such that they both set their respective atomics `a` and `b` to 1, violating the assertion, depending on how the memory reordering and visibility occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "With relaxed memory models, the given program can lead to the situation where both `a` and `b` become `1`, thus violating the final assertion. The effects of relaxed memory models like TSO and PSO make it challenging to predict the exact outcomes because they allow for read/write operations to see or not see the values in an order that does not reflect program order, leading to potential unexpected behaviors. \n",
      "\n",
      "For safe programming practices, especially in concurrent environments, this highlights the need for stronger memory ordering semantics (like acquiring locks, using `std::memory_order_acquire` and `std::memory_order_release`) to ensure correctness of shared state across threads.\n",

      "In the provided C++ program, three threads are created, and they use atomic operations with relaxed memory ordering. The implications of relaxed memory models, particularly Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), can significantly affect the behavior of this program. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Atomic Operations**: The program uses atomic variables (`x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`) to ensure that reads and writes to these variables are conducted in a thread-safe manner without explicit locks. The use of `std::memory_order_relaxed` means that these operations do not enforce any happens-before relationship or synchronization between threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Relaxed Memory Ordering**: \n",
      "   - **Total Store Order (TSO)**: In TSO, the writes to memory (stores) made by a thread are visible to that thread's future read operations in the order they were issued. However, visibility to other threads' reads is affected by the relaxed nature of the operations.\n",
      "   - **Partial Store Order (PSO)**: In PSO, stores can be reordered, but when a thread loads a variable, it can see the effects of stores as long as the store operation is complete by the time a load is issued.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Thread Behavior Explained\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1** (`thread1`):\n",
      "   - It stores the value `2` into `x`. This operation is atomic but only impacts visibility in relation to other threads based on relaxed memory ordering. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2** (`thread2`):\n",
      "   - It reads the value of `x`. Since `x` might not be visible with the value of `2` because it depends on thread scheduling, it could read `x` as `0` (the initial value) even after thread 1 has executed.\n",
      "   - It stores the value `1` into `y`.\n",
      "   - If `p` is `2`, it sets `a` to `1`. However, due to relaxed ordering, `p` may never see the update made by thread 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thread 3** (`thread3`):\n",
      "   - It sets `y` to `2` and then sets `x` to `1`. The order of these operations can become interleaved due to scheduling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Outcomes and Assertions\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the relaxed memory model, execution could result in various outcomes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scenario where `x` reads `2`**: This might occur if the scheduler allows thread 2 to execute after thread 1 has stored `2` in `x`. In this case:\n",
      "  - Assuming `p` reads `2`, then `a` is set to `1`, yielding `x = 2 || y = 1 || a = 1` which could violate the assert statement in the main function.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scenario where `x` reads `0`**: If thread 2 executes before thread 1, it's plausible that `p` would read `0`, and thus `a` would not be set to `1`. \n",
      "  - With `x` being `0` and `y` being `1`, it won't violate the assert.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the relaxed memory model can allow the threads to see values of shared variables that differ due to the weak consistency guarantees it provides. Due to TSO and PSO, the visible effects of writes can be out of order, leading to surprising results. Therefore, under relaxed ordering, it is possible for the assertion in the `main` function to pass or fail, depending completely on the execution order and scheduling of the threads (`thread1`, `thread2`, and `thread3`). \n",
      "\n",
      "To ensure a correct program behavior that aligns with the expected assertion, stronger memory orderings (like `std::memory_order_seq_cst`) would be recommended, which enforce stricter visibility rules across threads.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Components of the Program:\n",
      "1. **Atomic Variables**:\n",
      "   - `x`, `y`, and `a` are declared as `std::atomic<int>`, ensuring that operations on these variables are atomic.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread Operations**:\n",
      "   - `thread1` sets `x` to 2 and `y` to 1, using `std::memory_order_relaxed`, which does not impose any ordering constraints.\n",
      "   - `thread2` first loads the value of `y`, then uses an atomic fence with `memory_order_seq_cst` before setting `x` to 1 (also with relaxed memory order), and finally checks if `p` (the loaded value of `y`) is 1. If it is, it sets `a` to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Main Function**:\n",
      "   - The main function creates two threads and waits for them to finish. The assertion at the end checks that if `x` is 2, then `a` must not be 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relaxed Memory and Possible Outcomes:\n",
      "#### **In relaxed memory models**:\n",
      "- **Total Store Order (TSO)**: This model allows writes from the same thread to be seen in the order they were issued by that thread. However, it does not enforce a global order across all threads; this means that one thread might see the result of a write from another thread before that write has actually occurred from the perspective of the first thread.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Partial Store Order (PSO)**: This model allows some reordering of operations. In PSO, the writes to a single variable are seen in the order they occur, but different threads may see writes to different variables in a different order.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Behavior:\n",
      "1. **Execution Order**:\n",
      "   - Due to both `thread1` and `thread2` using `std::memory_order_relaxed`, there's no guarantee about the visibility of operations across threads immediately. When `thread1` stores `x = 2`, `thread2` may not see this value immediately due to relaxed ordering.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Atomic Fence**:\n",
      "   - The fence in `thread2` (`atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst)`) ensures that all operations before the fence in the invoking thread (in this case, the load of `y`) are visible before the operations following the fence (e.g., the store to `x`). However, it does not create a total order across all threads, so it cannot prevent `thread1` from operating in an isolated manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Assertion Violation**:\n",
      "   - The assertion checks that if `x` equals 2, `a` cannot equal 1. The combination of relaxed stores and the ordering imposed by the fence means that it’s possible for `y` in `thread2` to read as 1 (which would lead to setting `a` to 1), but `x` being observed as 2 can happen as well if `thread2` has not yet seen this change or if the threads interleave in a certain way.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Conclusion**:\n",
      "The relaxed memory models could lead to the following scenarios:\n",
      "- It's feasible for `p` in `thread2` to be 1 while `x` in `thread1` is 2 (setting `a` to 1), which would violate the assertion.\n",
      "- Alternatively, `x` could be read as 1 or 0 from `thread2`, and if the timing is right, the assertion wouldn't be violated but is sensitive to the timing and the ordering guarantees provided/relaxed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, with relaxed memory models, it's possible for programs to exhibit behaviors that may seem counterintuitive, leading to race conditions and potentially violating the assertion, particularly in the presence of multiple threads observing and modifying shared state without strict coordination.\n",

      "### Overview of the Program\n",
      "\n",
      "The program consists of two threads:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1** (`thread1`):\n",
      "   - Loads the value of `x`.\n",
      "   - Stores `1` in `x`.\n",
      "   - If the loaded value (`p`) equals `2`, it stores `1` in `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2** (`thread2`):\n",
      "   - Stores `2` in `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main function creates both threads and then waits for their completion. Finally, it asserts that either `a` is not equal to `1` or `x` is not equal to `2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Relaxed Memory Order\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Relaxed Semantics**:\n",
      "   - `memory_order_relaxed` introduces no synchronization or ordering guarantees with respect to other operations.\n",
      "   - This means that operations can be reordered freely, and visibility of writes across threads may be affected. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Total Store Order (TSO)**:\n",
      "   - In a TSO architecture, stores to memory by a thread are completed in order, but reads may see other threads' writes out-of-order.\n",
      "   - In this model, Thread 1 may load `x` before the store in Thread 2 takes effect; hence it can read the initial value of `x` while Thread 2 is concurrently modifying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "   - In PSO, there are no guarantees on how writes are seen by other threads, and visibility across threads can be quite complex.\n",
      "   - Under PSO, writes may not be visible immediately, making it possible for Thread 1 to observe an old value of `x` before it is updated by Thread 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Analysis of the Behavior\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the execution of this program and the effects of memory ordering:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Possible Execution Scenarios**:\n",
      "    - If Thread 2 executes its store (`x.store(2)`) before Thread 1 executes its load (`x.load()`), then `p` will be `2`, and `a` will be set to `1`.\n",
      "    - Conversely, if Thread 1 reads `x` before Thread 2 stores to it, `p` can be an initial value (`0` in this case since `x` is initialized to `0`), and `a` remains `0`.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Outcomes**:\n",
      "    - The assertion in the main function (`assert (a!=1 || x!=2)`) will pass if either condition is true. This assertion accounts for the potential scenarios of the relaxed memory model which may allow `Thread 1` to see its original read of `x` as `0` and not update `a`, even after `Thread 2` has written `2` to `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the relaxed memory order allows the threads to operate in ways that can lead to surprising results. Depending on how the operating system scheduler interleaves threads and the memory visibility rules, the following can happen:\n",
      "- Both threads may execute in a manner where `x` is seen as `0` by `Thread 1`, and thus `a` stays `0`.\n",
      "- Or if `Thread 2` runs first and updates `x` to `2`, `Thread 1` loads this value and subsequently updates `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "These relaxed memory models can lead to outcomes where the assertion holds true and yet `Thread 1` has seen a stale value of `x`. As a programmer, it's essential to understand these implications when using atomic operations with relaxed memory order, as they facilitate higher performance at the potential cost of expected synchronization guarantees.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Key Concepts of Relaxed Memory Models:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**:\n",
      "   - In TSO, the writes to memory can be reordered with respect to reads and writes, but within the same thread, operations occur in the order they were issued.\n",
      "   - This means that for one thread, the effects of its stores will be visible in the order they were issued, but other threads may observe these stores in a different order or not at all, leading to potential visibility issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "   - PSO allows more freedom in reordering than TSO. It allows stores to be reordered with respect to each other and can give a different set of visibility guarantees.\n",
      "   - In this model, a store may not necessarily be visible to other threads if they are executing concurrently.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implications in the Given Program:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Concurrent Writes to `x`**:\n",
      "   - `thread1` and `thread2` are writing to `x` simultaneously without any synchronization (like mutexes or memory barriers). Both threads use `std::memory_order_relaxed`, which does not provide any guarantees about visibility across threads. Hence, if `thread1` executes after the `thread2` store, `x` might appear as `1` or `2` for `thread3` and `thread4`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Observing `x` in `thread3` and `thread4`**:\n",
      "   - Both threads `thread3` and `thread4` read `x` using `load(std::memory_order_relaxed)`. Since they use relaxed semantics, they can see different values of `x` in their reads. It's conceivable that:\n",
      "     - `thread3` reads `x` as `1` first and `2` second (`p=1` and `q=2`).\n",
      "     - `thread4` reads `x` as `2` first and `1` second (`r=2` and `s=1`).\n",
      "   - As a result, both threads can set `a` and `b` respectively without any direct guarantees that their operations are synchronized, leading to the possibility of both variables being set to `1` or `2` simultaneously, violating the assertion in `main`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Assertion Behavior**:\n",
      "   - The assertion checks whether `a` is not both `1` and `b` not both `1`, or `a` is not both `2` and `b` not both `2`.\n",
      "   - With relaxed memory conditions and no barriers, it's very much possible that one of the conditions in the assertion might fail, which leads to undefined behavior. The assertion's failure would typically indicate that concurrent modifications led to an unwanted overlap in state among `a` and `b`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "Using relaxed memory order introduces a level of unpredictability and can lead to race conditions. In this particular program, the assertion may fail when run due to possible interleavings of the threads and the lack of visibility guarantees from relaxed memory operations. This exemplifies the challenges in writing concurrent programs using relaxed memory models, requiring care and often the use of stronger memory orderings or explicit synchronizations to ensure correctness.\n",

We'll go through the potential execution outcomes based on the memory model and the program's semantics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Program Overview\n",
      "- `thread1`:\n",
      "  1. Sets `x` to 2.\n",
      "  2. Executes a sequentially consistent fence (`std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`).\n",

      "  2. Executes a sequentially consistent fence.\n",
      "  3. Sets `x` to 1 if `p` (the value read from `y`) is equal to 1.\n",
      "  4. If `p` is 1, it stores 1 in `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Models Impact\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**:\n",
      "   - TSO allows stores to be seen in a consistent order by threads, but loads can be reordered with respect to earlier stores, as long as they do not affect the perceived order of operations where necessary.\n",
      "   - The sequential consistency fence (`std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`) ensures that all prior memory operations (both loads and stores) are completed before any subsequent memory operations.\n",
      "   - In this model, if `thread2` reads `y` after `thread1` has written to it, `p` can safely see `1` (indicating that the store operation in `thread1` happened). If `p` is indeed `1`, then `x` gets overwritten with `1` (potentially after having been set to `2`).\n",
      "   - Therefore, for `TSO`, the assertion `assert(x != 2 || a != 1);` can be violated if both threads execute as intended because `x` can end up being `1` and `a` can end up being `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "   - PSO allows greater reordering than TSO, specifically regarding the visibility of writes among threads. Stores may be propagated to other threads at different times without guaranteeing a total ordering.\n",
      "   - Thus, in PSO, `thread2` could read `y` as `0` while `thread1` has already written `2` to `x`. Because there's no guarantee on when or if the `y` store in `thread1` is perceived by `thread2`, `p` could be `0` (indicating a stale read).\n",
      "   - If `p` is `0`, `thread2` does not execute the store to `a`, and thus `a` remains unchanged.\n",
      "   - This further means that for `p == 0`, the condition `assert(x != 2 || a != 1);` holds true because `a` is not `1`, allowing for the assertion to pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "- Under **TSO**: The assertion can fail if `thread1` and `thread2` see each other's operations as per the constraints of the waiting period introduced by the sequential consistency fence, potentially leading to the case where `x` is `1` and `a` is `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Under **PSO**: The assertion is more likely to pass because `p` could read a stale value of `y`, resulting in `a` not being updated, and thus the condition in the assertion holds true when `x` equals `2`.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Relaxed Memory Operations**: The use of `std::memory_order_relaxed` allows the compiler and CPU to reorder operations freely as long as they respect the atomicity. This means that the operations on `std::atomic` variables do not have memory synchronization with operations on other atomic variables or non-atomic variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Potential Scenarios**: The two threads perform operations on shared atomic variables `x`, `y`, and `a`:\n",
      "   - **Thread 1** stores `2` in `x` and `1` in `y`.\n",
      "   - **Thread 2** loads from `y`, then stores `1` in `x`, and if the value loaded from `y` is `1`, it sets `a` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Possible Outcomes**:\n",
      "   - Thread 1 stores `2` in `x`; if Thread 2 reads `y` as `1` before Thread 1 writes `1` to it, it will proceed to set `a` to `1`. However, if Thread 2 executes its operations such that it completes storing `1` in `x` before it reads `y`, then `p` may read an unpredictable value (it could be a stale value due to relaxation).\n",
      "   - Concurrently, the operations from both threads may interleave in various ways, leading to different observable states of `x` and `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Assertions**: The assert `assert(x != 2 || a != 1);` checks if either `x` is not `2`, or `a` is not `1`. By using relaxed memory ordering, it's possible to have a situation where Thread 2 sees `y` as `1`, leading it to set `a` to `1` while simultaneously (due to the lack of synchronization) Thread 1 has stored `2` in `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Execution Scenario\n",
      "\n",
      "- Consider this interleaving:\n",
      "  1. Thread 1 executes successfully, setting `x = 2` and then `y = 1`.\n",
      "  2. Thread 2 could then load `y` right after its value was set to `1` (i.e., `p = 1`).\n",
      "  3. Next, Thread 2 sets `1` to `x` (`x` becomes `1`), then checks `p` and sees it as `1` hence it sets `a = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case, the assertion would not hold because both `x == 2` and `a == 1` would be true, which violates the assertion condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The relaxed memory orderings (TSO, PSO, etc.) can lead to potential non-intuitive results in concurrent programming due to the lack of strong consistency guarantees.

      "### Overview of Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Relaxed Memory Order**:\n",
      "   - Operations are performed with no restrictions on the order in which reads and writes can be seen by other threads.\n",
      "   - There may be reordering of operations as seen by other threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Total Store Order (TSO)**:\n",
      "   - Guarantees that all stores are observed by other threads in a specific order, but allows loads (reads) to be reordered freely with respect to stores.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "   - Allows both loads and stores to be reordered.\n",
      "   - Guarantees that loads from different threads will see the same order as the corresponding stores, but it allows writes to be visible in different orders across threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Program Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1**:\n",
      "    - It sets `x` to `2`, then employs a sequentially consistent fence, followed by setting `y` to `1`. With relaxed memory order, there's no guarantee that thread 3 or thread 4 will see these operations in a specific order.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2**:\n",
      "    - It sets `y` to `2`, then uses a sequentially consistent fence, followed by setting `x` to `1`. Similar to thread 1, the relaxed memory model allows for potential reordering.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Thread 3**:\n",
      "    - It loads `x` twice. The values read can theoretically be any valid value due to the relaxed memory operations, meaning `p` could be `1`, followed potentially by reading `2` in the next load.\n",

      "4. **Thread 4**:\n",
      "    - It operates similarly to thread 3 but with `y`. Depending on how the reads return values, `p` and `q` could end up being `1` and `2` as needed to set `b` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Outcomes and Assertions\n",
      "\n",
      "- The `assert` condition at the end checks that `a` and `b` are not both `1`. Due to the relaxed memory model's properties, all scenarios are quite possible based on how the threads see memory locations:\n",
      "    - Both `a` and `b` can be set to `1` based on the interleaving of instructions. This can lead to a failure of the assertion.\n",
      "    - In many interleavings, at least one of the stores to `a` or `b` might occur after the corresponding loads happened, allowing them to never satisfy the `if` condition leading to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Given relaxed memory models, particularly TSO or PSO, it is possible for this program to fail the assertion due to race conditions stemming from the lack of inter-thread synchronization beyond the sequential consistency fence. Both `a` and `b` could obtain the value `1` if the threads are interleaved in a specific way due to relaxed operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the assertion `assert(a != 1 || b != 1);` could potentially fail, and this program showcases the susceptibility to data races and non-determinism in multithreaded applications that involve relaxed memory models. This illustrates the importance of understanding memory visibility and ordering characteristics when writing concurrent code.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Memory Model Background:\n",
      "### Total Store Order (TSO):\n",
      "- TSO guarantees that writes from a single thread are serialized (observed in order) by all threads. However, it allows for some reordering of reads and writes to different locations between threads.\n",
      "- Load operations can be seen in a different order by different threads, especially when using relaxed memory ordering.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Partial Store Order (PSO):\n",
      "- PSO allows more flexibility than TSO, permitting even more complex reorderings. It can interleave loads and stores to the same variable across different threads.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### Program Breakdown:\n",
      "The program creates three threads:\n",
      "1. **Thread 1** (`thread1`): This thread sets `x` to `1`.\n",
      "2. **Thread 2** (`thread2`): This thread loads `x` and then `y`. If `x` is `1` and `y` is `0`, it sets `a` to `1`.\n",
      "3. **Thread 3** (`thread3`): This thread sets `y` to `1`, then loads `x`. If `x` is `0`, it sets `b` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Scenarios:\n",
      "In a relaxed memory model environment, several interleavings can generate surprising results:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initialization**:\n",
      "   - `x` and `y` are initially `0`.\n",
      "   - `a` and `b` are also initially `0`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread Interactions**:\n",
      "   - If `thread1` runs before `thread2` and `thread3`, it sets `x` to `1` before they check its value.\n",
      "   - However, since `y` is `0` at the beginning, both threads can reach the condition where `a` gets set to `1` if `thread2` reads `x` after `thread1` writes to it.\n",
      "   - `thread3` sets `y` to `1` after it executes its store operation. However, if `thread2` reads `x` after `thread1` has updated it and before `thread3` has set `y` to `1`, it can trigger the condition to set `a` based on `p == 1 && q == 0`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Critical Race Condition**:\n",
      "   - The key point here is that the loads from `x` and `y` are not guaranteed to happen in a specific order because they both use `memory_order_relaxed`. This means it's possible for `thread3` to store `y` as `1`, and then `thread2` might read `y` after it became `1`.\n",
      "   - Thus, `thread2` may fail its if-condition with `b` stored as `1` while `a` is also possibly `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Memory Model Effects:\n",
      "- In TSO, you could say you are more likely to see observable \"more correct\" behavior, as both writes and reads to the same memory location happen in order and synchronously. But relaxed models allow for both `a` and `b` to become `1`, as the coordinates of writes and reads could result in imbalanced operations.\n",
      "- With PSO, since even more reordering is allowed, it may lead to scenarios where both the variables `a` and `b` could be set to `1`, potentially leading to unexpected and unintended behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "The assert condition `assert (a != 1 || b != 1);` checks if both `a` and `b` do not equal `1` concurrently. However, under relaxed memory models like TSO or PSO, it's quite possible (and permissible under those models) for both variables to end up being `1`, thus violating the assert and showing the non-deterministic behavior of relaxed memory models in multithreaded environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "This scenario showcases the necessity for proper memory ordering and synchronization in multithreaded programs to avoid data races and unexpected results. To ensure that `a` and `b` can never be `1` simultaneously, techniques such as mutexes or atomic operations with stricter memory orders would be required.\n",

      "3. **Thread Behavior**:\n",
      "   - `thread1` executes:\n",
      "     - `x.store(2, std::memory_order_relaxed);`\n",

      "### Possible Interleavings\n",
      "\n",
      "The strong fence (`std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`) in `thread1` ensures that all preceding operations (i.e., `x.store(2)`) will be visible to other threads before any following operations (like `y.store(1)`) are executed. \n",
      "\n",

      "  \n",

However, `thread2` may still see the operations to `y` and `x` in any order relative to each other, which allows the program to generate different outcomes based on the timing of thread execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Behavior and Assertion\n",
      "\n",
      "The assertion `assert( x != 2 || y != 2);` at the end implies that if `x` is `2`, then `y` must not be `2`. Here are the key scenarios considering relaxed models:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If `thread1` successfully writes `2` to `x` before `thread2` writes `1` to `x`, then `x` will become `2`.\n",
      "- If `thread2` writes `2` to `y` and then writes `1` to `x`, it is possible to achieve states where `x` and `y` can either be `2` or `1` respectively, but in a way that satisfies the assertion due to the nature of the racing conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, using TSO or PSO here would still yield behavior that might initially seem chaotic but must uphold the assert due to the synchronization imposed through the fence. The program might print outputs where `x` can be `2` and `y` can never become `2` simultaneously, ensuring the assertion holds true post-execution. \n",

      "\n",
      "### Memory Models Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO)**: This is a commonly used memory model for x86 architectures. It guarantees a consistent view of memory operations (loads and stores) across different threads while still allowing some optimization. Devices using TSO ensure that writes issued by a thread will be seen in the same order by all threads. However, they allow reordering of loads and stores to be performed so long as the overall order is maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**: This model is more relaxed than TSO and permits more aggressive optimizations. PSO allows different threads to see the results of operations in a non-deterministic order. It effectively lets stores and loads be observed out of the order in which they were issued in some scenarios, making it easier for processors to read and write data in ways that may not respect the actual program order as seen in single-threaded code.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Program Behavior and Relaxed Memory Order\n",
      "\n",
      "In the provided program, the following key points should be noted:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The code sets up two threads. `thread1` writes to `x`, waits for a sequential fence, and then reads `y`. If `y` is `0`, it writes to `a`. Similarly, `thread2` writes to `y`, reads `x`, and writes to `b` if `x` is `0`.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The sequential fence (`std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`) in `thread1` ensures that all previous operations (the store to `x`) are completed before any subsequent operations (the load from `y`) are allowed to access memory. However, since `thread2` does not have any such fence or synchronization barrier, it might still observe the write to `y` before the write to `x` completes due to relaxed memory operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Potential Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's analyze what scenarios can arise under TSO and PSO:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **With TSO** (which is still somewhat relaxed but more strict than PSO):\n",
      "   - After `thread1` stores `1` to `x`, `thread2` can see `1` in `x` only after `thread1` sees that `y` is `1`. \n",
      "   - The assert statement `assert(a != 1 || b != 1);` is likely to hold true (i.e., it will not trigger) under TSO because one of the `stores` (to `a` or `b`) will take precedence based on the observed values due to the sequencing of operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **With PSO**:\n",
      "   - The ordering of the execution can lead to a situation where `thread1` sees `y` as `0` (because it is not guaranteed to see `thread2`'s store to `y`), leading to `a` being set to `1`. \n",
      "   - At the same time, `thread2` can read `x` as `0`, thus setting `b` to `1`. \n",
      "   - This can lead to a violation of the assert condition (`a == 1 && b == 1`), which may be observed in a race condition arising partly due to the relaxed model.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary and Implications\n",
      "\n",
      "- Under relaxed models (like PSO), it's possible for threads to behave unexpectedly, and the program may not work as intended, particularly because the operations can be seen in varied orders due to the lack of sufficient synchronization.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- The assert could fail under certain conditions, indicating that the two threads may both end up writing `1` to `a` and `b` when logic suggests this should not be possible, as one thread's entry condition relies on the other thread's state, creating a race condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proper synchronization techniques such as using mutexes or more stringent memory barriers should be employed to ensure consistent behavior across different memory models.\n",

      "To understand how relaxed memory models like Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) can affect the behavior of the given multithreaded C++ program, we first need to parse through the program's structure and data dependencies among the threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Understanding the Program:\n",
      "1. **Shared Atomic Variables**:\n",
      "   - `std::atomic<int> x;`\n",
      "   - `std::atomic<int> y;`\n",
      "   - `std::atomic<int> a;`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread Functions**:\n",
      "   - **Thread 1**: Stores `2` in `x`.\n",
      "   - **Thread 2**: Reads `x` into `p` (with relaxed memory order), performs a sequentially consistent fence, and then stores `1` in `y`. If `p` is equal to `2`, it stores `1` in `a`.\n",
      "   - **Thread 3**: Stores `2` in `y` and then stores `1` in `x`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Main Function**: \n",
      "   - Creates three threads and waits for them to finish before checking an assertion about the values of `x`, `y`, and `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Points of Memory Models:\n",
      "- **Total Store Order (TSO)**: In TSO, writes from a single thread appear in order, but writes across different threads can be reordered as long as they respect the \"happens-before\" relation defined by synchronization (e.g., mutex locks, barriers). Reads can see writes from the same thread before the relevant fence. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Partial Store Order (PSO)**: PSO allows for a more relaxed model where store operations may not necessarily follow the order of instructions in certain contexts, provided that memory dependencies are maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Program Behavior with Relaxed Memory Models:\n",
      "- The program can have multiple execution results due to the lack of synchronization between threads and the relaxed operations used.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- In **Thread 2**, the load of `x` may see a value of `0` (the default initial value) because it may execute before or after `Thread 1` in a manner affected by relaxed operations, even if `Thread 1` has executed previously.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The sequentially consistent fence (`std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)`) guarantees that all operations before the fence in the current thread (Thread 2) must complete before any operations after the fence. This does create a partial point of synchronization but does not guarantee to 'see' updates from other threads that have relaxed stores before the fence, due to potential reordering from the relaxed memory orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Thread 3** can execute and update `y` to `2` while `Thread 1` has updated `x` to `2`. If `Thread 2` executes in a certain way, it might never read that `x` has been written to `2` before both threads finish.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Assert Scenarios:\n",
      "- **Valid Execution Cases**:\n",
      "  - `x` can be `2`, `y` can be `1`, and `a` can be `1` if `Thread 1` executes after `Thread 2` reads `p`.\n",
      "  - Assertions might pass if `Thread 3` sets `y` to `2` and `Thread 1` does not synchronize effectively with `Thread 2`'s load.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Invalid/Unexpected Execution Cases**:\n",
      "  - If `p` reads `2` due to a race condition, `a` can be set. In such cases, you would see behavior not anticipated (the assertion being violated) because memory visibility is relaxed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Relaxed memory models in the presence of multiple threads can lead to unexpected results due to the possibility of various reorderings and visibility of memory operations. The program's assertion might be true or false depending on the interleaving of thread execution, which is crucial under relaxed memory models like TSO and PSO. The key takeaway is that while relaxed operations increase performance, they can introduce complexity in reasoning about threading and shared state.\n",

The behavior of this program can be deeply affected by the memory model in use, especially under relaxed memory models such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Basic Understanding of Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Relaxed Memory Model**: In a relaxed memory model, operations on memory (especially writes) may not occur in the order they are issued by the threads. This means that threads may see values in a different order than they were written, depending on when they read the values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Total Store Order (TSO)**: TSO allows loads to be reordered with respect to each other, but stores are seen strictly in the order they were executed. This means that a thread can see the effects of stores made by other threads in a way that adheres to program order for stores, but loads may be reordered. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Partial Store Order (PSO)**: PSO is a less strict model than TSO. It permits loads and stores to be partially reordered. This means that a thread might see updates from other threads in a non-intuitive manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact on the Program\n",
      "\n",
      "The key focus here is on the assert in the main program: `assert( x != 2 || y != 3 );`. This means that, if `x` equals `2`, then `y` must not equal `3` for the assert to pass. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Thread Behavior\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1** sets `x` to `2` and then sets `y` to `1`.\n",
      "2. **Thread 2** sets `y` to `3` and then sets `x` to `4`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Outcomes\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the relaxed memory models, the following outcomes can occur:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1 Completes First**: Suppose Thread 1 executes first and sets `x` to `2` and then `y` to `1`. After this completes, we can have:\n",
      "   - `x = 2` and `y = 1` - This would not trigger the assert.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Thread 2 Completes First**: If Thread 2 sets `y` to `3` first and then `x` to `4`, then afterwards:\n",
      "   - `x = 4` and `y = 3` - This would also not trigger the assert.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Interleavings**: However, because of relaxed memory (especially in PSO), Thread 1 and Thread 2 can have interleaved executions:\n",
      "   - Thread 1 sets `x = 2`\n",
      "   - Thread 2 sets `y = 3`\n",
      "   - Thread 1 sets `y = 1`\n",
      "   - Thread 2 sets `x = 4`\n",
      "  \n",
      "   In this final state, the values at the end would be:\n",
      "   - `x = 4` and `y = 1` - This does not trigger the assert.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Unexpected Visibility**: Yet, due to memory reordering, it's also possible (though implausible under these atomic operations) that Thread 2 could see `x = 2` and `y = 3` if operations were reordered at the store level (which might not normally happen but could theoretically if compilers optimized it in an unintended way).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The main takeaway is:\n",
      "- The assert `assert( x != 2 || y != 3 );` could theoretically fail due to relaxed memory semantics, specifically around visibility and ordering.\n",
      "- In practice, given the atomic operations, it’s more likely that the assert will pass, but inconsistency in visibility between threads under relaxed orders can lead to behavior that is unpredictable without stronger memory guarantees (like sequential consistency).\n",
      "- Always ensure proper synchronization when working with shared variables, particularly when using relaxed memory models, to avoid unintended behavior and maintain program correctness.\n",

      "### Overview of the Code\n",
      "This program consists of three threads that manipulate shared atomic variables `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` using relaxed memory orderings and sequential consistency fences. Here’s a breakdown of how the threads work:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Thread 1:** Sets `x` to `1`.\n",
      "- **Thread 2:** Reads `x`, checks if it is `1`, and then reads `y`. If `y` is `0`, it sets `a` to `1`.\n",
      "- **Thread 3:** Sets `y` to `1`, reads `x`, and if `x` is `0`, it sets `b` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Effects of Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Store Order (TSO):**\n",
      "   - TSO is a common memory model for processors that allows reordering of stores and relevant loads but guarantees that a store will be visible to all threads in the same order in which they were executed. \n",
      "   - If TSO were in effect:\n",
      "     - The store to `x` in Thread 1 would be guaranteed to be visible before any subsequent load from `x` by Thread 2 or Thread 3.\n",
      "     - This means that if Thread 1 runs before both Thread 2 and Thread 3, Thread 2 would see `x` as `1`. If Thread 2 does see `x` as `1`, the only way for `y` to equal `0` is if Thread 3 hadn’t written to `y` yet, which could not happen here since Thread 3 writes to `y` before it could read `x`.\n",
      "     - In TSO, the assert will always pass.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Partial Store Order (PSO):**\n",
      "   - PSO allows for a similar level of reordering but makes less stringent guarantees about visibility of loads and stores to individual threads. Under this model, stores may be observed in different orders by different threads, which introduces more non-determinism.\n",
      "   - If PSO is the memory model used:\n",
      "     - Thread 2 might read `x` as `1`, but due to potential reordering of operations in thread execution, Thread 3 might store to `y` and then load from `x` while seeing `0` (if Thread 1 executes after Thread 3 in terms of visibility).\n",
      "     - This allows cases where Thread 2 can find `p == 1` and `q == 0`, thus leading to `a` being set to `1` and `b` remaining unchanged.\n",
      "     - The assert could potentially fail in this scenario since both `a` and `b` could be set in conditions where `y == 2`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Under relaxed memory models like TSO and PSO, the program presents different behaviors:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **With TSO**, the program will consistently yield `y != 2 || a != 1`, as the stores are well ordered.\n",
      "- **With PSO**, there is a potential for the assert to fail due to the reordering and visibility effects that may let `a` and `b` both be set to `1`. \n",
      "\n",
      "The use of `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)` helps enforce a visibility barrier at certain points in the program, but it does not fully eliminate the non-determinism introduced by relaxed operations preceding it. Thus, understanding the implications of these memory models is critical for predicting the behavior of concurrent programs.\n",

      "### Behavior of the Program\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thread 1:**\n",
      "   - It first stores `1` in `x`.\n",
      "   - Then, it loads the value of `y`. If `y` is `0`, it stores `1` in `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread 2:**\n",
      "   - It first stores `1` in `y`.\n",
      "   - Then, it loads the value of `x`. If `x` is `0`, it stores `1` in `b`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Main Function:**\n",
      "   - It creates and runs both threads before joining them.\n",
      "   - Finally, it asserts that at least one of `a` or `b` is not equal to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Possible Outcomes Under Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to relaxed memory order, there are no guarantees on the visibility of writes across threads. Here's how relaxed memory models, specifically Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), might affect program behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Total Store Order (TSO):**\n",
      "  In a TSO system, stores to a variable are made visible to other threads in the order they were issued. However, loads can be reordered with respect to stores (as long as they don't change the order of visibility of the loads). This means:\n",
      "  - If `thread1` executes `x.store(1)` before `thread2` performs `y.store(1)`, `thread2` might still see the previous value of `x` (which could still be `0`) if the store to `y` hasn't been visible yet.\n",
      "  - Thus `p` or `q` might still be `0`, allowing both `a` and `b` to potentially be set to `1`, violating the assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Partial Store Order (PSO):**\n",
      "  PSO allows for even more relaxation, where stores may not need to be seen by other threads in the order they were issued. In this case:\n",
      "  - Since both threads are using atomic operations with `memory_order_relaxed`, `thread2` might observe `y` stored as `1` before it observes the `x` store operation that occurred in `thread1`, or vice-versa.\n",
      "  - This further increases the probability of both conditions being satisfied (both `p` and `q` ending up as `0` at the time of evaluation) and could allow both `a` and `b` to be set to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that both threads can see either `x` or `y` at different points in time (depending on the operating system's scheduling and CPU behaviors), it is possible for both `a` and `b` to be set to `1`, which would violate the assertion:\n",

      "### Overview of Memory Models\n",
      "Relaxed memory models allow for flexibility in the order of operations—especially writes and reads—across different threads. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Total Store Order (TSO)**: This model allows reads and writes to appear to happen in program order for each thread, but allows reordering of operations between threads, except in how they observe each other's writes. This means that if a thread writes to a variable, another thread can only read this variable after the write is perceived to be complete.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Partial Store Order (PSO)**: This allows for even more flexibility than TSO with regards to how threads see writes. Operations can be reordered more aggressively, especially involving writes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Program Behavior Analysis\n",
      "1. **Thread Execution**:\n",
      "   - `thread1` sets `x` to `2`.\n",
      "   - `thread2` reads `x` twice and checks the values. If on both occasions, the first load returns `2` and the second load returns `0`, then it stores `1` in `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Possible Values for `x`**:\n",
      "   - Memory ordering rules allow `thread2` to see the writes to `x` in a different order depending on memory model semantics. With relaxed memory operations, there is no guarantee that the second load in `thread2` (`q = x.load(...)`) sees the effects of the first store to `x` by `thread1`. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Interleaving of Threads**: \n",
      "   - If `thread1` completes its execution and updates `x` to `2` before `thread2` starts executing, `thread2` could observe `x` as `2` for the first read and still potentially observe its initial state of `0` from the second read depending on the memory model in place.\n",
      "   - Due to the relaxed memory orders, it is possible (and likely in this case with relaxed operations) that `thread2` could actually read `x` as `0` for both loads, which would not trigger the write to `a`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact on `assert(a != 1);`:\n",
      "- Now within the `main` function, the final assertion expects `a` to not be `1`.\n",
      "- With the behavior of relaxed memory order, there are cases—specifically if the reordering or visibility lets `thread2` read `0` for both reads—that `a` will never be set to `1`.\n",
      "- Thus, the assertion would hold true across many interleavings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Given the relaxed operations and the possible behaviors allowed under relaxed memory models (especially with PSO), it is indeed feasible for `a` to remain `0`, leading to the assertion succeeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, this means that you can safely assume `a` does not get set to `1` through the combination of how operations are scheduled and how memory visibility interacts between threads in this specific case.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### Threads\n",
      "- **Thread 1 (`thread1`)**:\n",
      "  - Sets `x` to 2.\n",
      "  - Sets `y` to 1.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Thread 2 (`thread2`)**:\n",
      "  - Reads `y` into `p` (which might read the most recent write from `thread1`).\n",
      "  - Issues a sequentially consistent fence (`atomic_thread_fence(memory_order_seq_cst)`), which ensures that all previous operations in this thread are visible to other threads before any subsequent operations.\n",
      "  - Sets `x` to 1.\n",
      "  - If `p == 1`, it sets `a` to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "### How Relaxed Memory Models Affect Behavior\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Race Conditions**: Both threads are accessing and modifying shared variables (`x`, `y`, `a`) without mutual exclusion, leading to a race condition. The order of operations may not occur as one might intuitively expect due to the lack of synchronization between the threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Memory Ordering**:\n",
      "   - **Total Store Order (TSO)**: It requires the store operations to complete before subsequent loads are executed. If TSO were in effect, it would prevent thread 2 from reordering its operations in a way that could miss the previous writes by thread 1.\n",
      "   - **Partial Store Order (PSO)**: Allows some level of reordering — it permits reads and writes on different variables to occur out of order. Under PSO, `thread2` might see `y = 1` (written by `thread1`), but due to the lack of stronger memory ordering for `x`, it might not observe `x` as `2` at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Possible Execution Scenarios**:\n",
      "   - Given the relaxed memory order, `thread2` may read `y` as `1` (the value set by `thread1`), but when it executes `x.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed)`, it may not see the earlier write to `x` as `2` due to reordering allowed by relaxed memory constraints.\n",
      "   - Consequently, under certain execution scenarios, it's possible for `p == 1` to hold true when `x` still equals `2` because `thread1`'s operation to set `x` may not yet be visible to `thread2` at the moment it reads `y`.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Assertions**:\n",
      "   - The assertion `assert(x != 2 || a != 1);` tests a specific condition that is intended to hold true in the presence of the race conditions and relaxed memory model. If `x` equals `2` when `a` equals `1`, the assertion fails and the program terminates.\n",
      "   - In essence, this asserts that if `x` is ever observed to be `2`, then `a` should not be observed to be `1`, which aligns with typical behaviors expected due to race conditions and memory model effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Under relaxed memory models like TSO and PSO:\n",
      "- The interleaving and visibility of updates can lead to unexpected results.\n",
      "- Threads might not see writes by other threads instantly, leading to potential violations of the assumptions embedded in the assertion.\n",
      "- This example highlights the importance of understanding memory models in concurrent programming to avoid subtle bugs and ensure correctness when using shared variables across threads. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "- Use stronger memory orderings (like `memory_order_seq_cst`) where necessary to avoid subtle bugs or unintended behaviors, especially when correctness is critical.\n",
      "- Consider using synchronization primitives (like mutexes) when managing shared state to enforce clearer control over concurrent accesses.\n",

      "- `y` can only be written once by Thread 3 to `1`. Thus, `y` being `2` is an impossible state.\n",

      "\n",
      "Given the nature of operations (relaxed loads/stores and `seq_cst` fences) and the memory models (TSO or PSO), the assertion seems logically correct and robust, barring implementation bugs outside of high-level semantics.\n",

      "- **Thread 1 (thread1)**:\n",
      "  - `x.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);` sets `x` to `1`.\n",

      "### Impact of Relaxed Memory Models\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Total Store Order (TSO):\n",
      "\n",
      "TSO allows load-store reordering but maintains a constraint that all stores from a single processor become visible in order to other processors. \n",
      "\n",
      "For this particular program:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Thread 1's store to `x` might be delayed and not immediately visible to Thread 2.\n",
      "2. Similarly, Thread 2's store to `y` might be delayed and not immediately visible to Thread 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes it possible for both Thread 1 to see `y` as `0` and set `a` to `1`, and Thread 2 to see `x` as `0` and set `b` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO):\n",
      "\n",
      "PSO allows both load-store and store-store reordering, making memory order even more relaxed compared to TSO. Stores by a processor can be observed out of order by other processors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Thread 1 may see `y` as `0` because the store to `y` by Thread 2 may not have propagated yet.\n",
      "- Thread 2 may see `x` as `0` because the store to `x` by Thread 1 may not have propagated yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Consequence\n",
      "\n",
      "Because both TSO and PSO allow sufficient reordering and delays in visibility of stores:\n",
      "\n",
      "- It is possible for Thread 1 to execute `a.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);` because it sees `y` as `0`.\n",
      "- It is also possible for Thread 2 to execute `b.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);` because it sees `x` as `0`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, under relaxed memory models, the scenario where both `a` and `b` are equal to `1` simultaneously can indeed happen. This would violate the assertion `assert ( a != 1 || b != 1);`, leading to a potential assertion failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Under both TSO and PSO, the provided multithreaded program can reach a state where both `a == 1` and `b == 1`, violating the assertion at the end. This demonstrates how relaxed memory models allow results that would not be possible under sequential consistency, leading to behaviors that need to be carefully considered when writing concurrent programs.\n",

      "  - It provides no ordering guarantees with respect to other threads beyond atomicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Effect on Program:**\n",
      "  - Due to the reordering allowed by relaxed operations, there's no guarantee that the two load operations in `thread2` will observe consistent or up-to-date values of `x`.\n",
      "  - Specifically, `thread2` can load `2` into `p` in the first load, and then load `0` into `q` in the second load, even if `thread1` has already stored `2` to `x`. This can happen because the loads are not synchronized and can be reordered.\n",
      "  - Hence, the condition `(p == 2) && (q == 0)` might become true, leading to `a` being set to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Total Store Order (TSO):\n",
      "- **Properties:**\n",
      "  - TSO maintains a single global order of all stores but allows loads to occur out of order with respect to earlier writes from the same processor. \n",
      "\n",
      "- **Effect on Program:**\n",
      "  - In TSO, while `x.store(2)` in `thread1` will appear in a global order, the load operations in `thread2` can still appear out of order.\n",
      "  - The result is similar: `p` could observe `2` and `q` could observe `0`, causing the same issue of potentially setting `a` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Partial Store Order (PSO):\n",
      "- **Properties:**\n",
      "  - PSO allows store operations to different locations to be reordered more freely.\n",
      "  - Loads might still observe stores out of the expected order, similar to TSO but with additional flexibility for stores specifically.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Effect on Program:**\n",
      "  - In PSO, the relaxed load and store operations in the threads can still lead to reordering that allows the condition `((p == 2) && (q == 0))` to be met, setting `a` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "Under relaxed memory models such as TSO or PSO, `thread2` might observe a value of `2` for `p` and a value of `0` for `q` due to reordering and the lack of synchronization constraints. As a result, the condition `(p == 2) && (q == 0)` can evaluate to true, causing the assertion `assert(a != 1)` to potentially fail. The code, as written, does not have enough synchronization to prevent this issue, making it possible for `a` to be set to `1`, which the assertion at the end of `main` assumes should never happen.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Under sequential consistency**: If operations were strictly ordered, if `p` is observed to be `1` in Thread 2, then `x` should have been set to `1` by Thread 2, making `a` be `1`. In this case, `x == 2 && a == 1` would not occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Under Total Store Order (TSO) or Partial Store Order (PSO)**:\n",
      "  - TSO allows loads to be reordered before previous stores to different locations, but stores are observed in order.\n",
      "  - PSO allows both stores and loads to be reordered more flexibly, compared to TSO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the reordering, it is conceivable that:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Thread 1: `x.store(2)` happens, then `y.store(1)` executes.\n",
      "- Thread 2: `y.load()` (getting the value `1`), fence, `x.store(1)`, and `a.store(1)` happen in separate orders across different CPU cores. This can cause the state where:\n",
      "  - Thread 1: `x` is initially set to `2`.\n",
      "  - Thread 2: sees `y` updated (they see `1`), then updates `x` to `1` after the fence and sets `a` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the relaxed model, Thread 1 setting `x` to `2` might be delayed to be observed by Thread 2 after Thread 2 stores to `x`, leading to interleaved states where `a` stores updated first and `x` stores later contribute to:\n",
      "- `a` might be logically set to `1` (by Thread 2)\n",
      "- returning to observing `x` as `2` (since initial set from Thread 1 updated globally might reflect).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "It's feasible under relaxed conditions hence `x == 2 && a == 1` can happen. Such interleaving in relaxed orders makes the assert failing but rare based on timing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, the `assert(x != 2 || a != 1)` can fail, and the program could hit the unexpected combined state when analyzing under relaxed memory models like TSO and PSO.\n",

For example, if `x.store(1)` and `y.store(1)` are executed before `p = x.load()` and `r = x.load()`, the end result would cause the assertion to fail as both `a` and `b` could be simultaneously `1`.\n",

In other words, it's possible to propagate the `store` to `x` in `thread1` and `store` to `y` in `thread2`, but not see them in `thread2`'s `load` of `x` and `thread1`'s `load` of `y`.\n",

However, the store operation `x.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);` by `thread2` may also be witnessed by `thread1` before its own store operation `x.store(2, std::memory_order_relaxed);` because `y.store(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);` and `x.store(2, std::memory_order_relaxed);` can be reordered.

      "\n",
      "Using **TSO** or **PSO** can make the behavior of this program less predictable:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **TSO (Total Store Order)**:\n",
      "    - This model still ensures a certain order of stores but allows loads to be reordered freely relative to stores. It allows older stores to loads to be visible later.\n",
      "    - Considering the fences in `thread2` and `thread3`, loads and stores around these fences should be more predictable. However, since `thread1` stores `x = 1` in relaxed order, `thread3` might see `x = 0` even if the store by `thread1` happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **PSO (Partial Store Order)**:\n",
      "    - This model allows even more relaxations compared to TSO. Loads and some stores can be highly reordered.\n",
      "    - Due to more freedom in ordering, it is more challenging to predict the order in which stores are visible to other threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexities introduced by the relaxed models, let's outline a possible interleaving:\n",
      "- `thread1` sets `x = 1`.\n",
      "- `thread2` loads `x` into `p`, gets `p = 1`.\n",
      "- `thread3` sets `y = 1`.\n",
      "- Fences ensure operations before the fence are \"visible\" before those after the fence.\n",
      "- `thread3` reads `x` into `r`, still sees `x = 0` (as the setting of `x` might not have propagated yet), sets `b = 1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "This scenario could lead to both conditions (`a == 1`, `b == 1`) occurring, which would violate the assertion, demonstrating that the relaxed memory model introduces complexity where both variables `a` and `b` can be 1 simultaneously.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these behaviors, in a relaxed memory model (TSO or PSO), there is indeed a risk that both `a` and `b` could be set to 1, making the program assertion invalid, and such interleavings highlight how relaxed memory models can impact multi-threaded programs. The analysis demonstrates the challenges of ensuring consistency and correctness in concurrent programs using relaxed memory ordering.\n",

      "The provided C++ program illustrates a concurrent scenario using multiple threads and atomic operations. It demonstrates how relaxed memory models affect the visibility of changes made by one thread to other threads, which can lead to non-intuitive results and behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key points about the program:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Atomic Variables**: The variables `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b` are declared as atomic integers. This ensures that operations on these variables are atomically visible across threads.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Thread Functionality**:\n",
      "   - `thread1` sets `x` to `1`.\n",
      "   - `thread2` reads `x` into `p` before a sequentially consistent fence and then reads `y` into `q`. If `p == 1` and `q == 0`, it sets `a` to `1`.\n",
      "   - `thread3` sets `y` to `1`, waits for a sequentially consistent fence, and then reads `x` into `r`. If `r == 0`, it sets `b` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Memory Fences**: `std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_seq_cst)` is used to create a synchronization point, enforcing that all previous operations on the current thread must be completed before any following operations (in the same thread) can proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Behavior under Relaxed Memory Models:\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of relaxed memory models like Total Store Order (TSO) or Partial Store Order (PSO):\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Visibility of writes**: With relaxed memory models, there is no guarantee that writes made by one thread will be visible to other threads immediately or in the order expected. For example:\n",
      "  - In `thread1`, `x` is set to `1`, but if `thread2` and `thread3` are scheduled before the write to `x` becomes visible to them, they may read old values of `x` and `y` (e.g., `0`).\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Outcomes influenced by ordering**:\n",
      "  - If `thread2` executes and reads `0` for `q` (if `thread3` hasn't executed yet and set `y`), and if `p` was read (maybe due to timing) as `1`, it can set `a` to `1`.\n",
      "  - Similarly, in `thread3`, if it sets `y` to `1` and then reads `0` for `x` (which is also influenced by the timing/scheduling), it may set `b` to `1`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Resulting Behavior and Assertion:\n",
      "\n",
      "The assertion `assert(a != 1 || b != 1)` is assessing whether at least one of `a` or `b` is not set to `1`. Given the possibility of thread scheduling and visibility issues under relaxed memory models, it is possible for both `a` and `b` to be set to `1`, violating the assertion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, under models like TSO and PSO, the behavior of the program could lead to:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Contradictory states**: The threads could see `x` as `1` and `y` as `0` (or vice-versa), leading to both `a` and `b` being set to `1`, which breaks the assertion.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the combination of relaxed memory models and the nature of thread scheduling could lead to a situation where the assertion fails. The outcome is influenced heavily by how the compiler and processor reorder instructions and how the memory visibility is managed among multiple threads. If strict memory ordering (like sequential consistency) were enforced instead of relaxed models, we would see more predictable behavior with respect to the visibility of atomic operations.\n",

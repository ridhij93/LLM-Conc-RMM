The assertion in the `main` function checks whether `y` is equal to 2 and `a` is equal to 1 at the same time, which should not be possible if the program is executed sequentially. However, due to the data race, it is possible for `thread2` to observe the value of `x` as 0 and set `a` to 1 before `thread1` sets `y` to 1, leading to the assertion failure.\n",

For example, you can use `std::atomic<int>` to declare `x`, `y`, and `a` as atomic variables, and use their `load()` and `store()` methods to read and write their values, respectively. Alternatively, you can use `std::mutex` to protect the shared variables with a lock, and use `std::lock_guard` to acquire and release the lock automatically when accessing the variables.\n",

      "1. Thread 1 and Thread 2 are both writing to `x` and `y`. If Thread 1 is preempted by the OS after setting `x=2` but before setting `y=1`, then Thread 2 might run and set `y=2` and `x=1`. This would result in an inconsistent state where `x` and `y` are not as expected.\n",

If Thread 3 reads `x` (p=x) and then gets preempted, Thread 1 or Thread 2 might change the value of `x` before Thread 3 reads `x` again (q=x).

This would result in both `a` and `b` being 1, violating the assertion.\n",
